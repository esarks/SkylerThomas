### Chapter 2: Too Much of a Good Thing
**Based on:** "Too Much of a Good Thing"

**Opening Scene (2-3 pages):**

You're standing in your closet, staring at clothes you don't wear, tags still on some of them. Or scrolling through streaming services for twenty minutes, unable to choose from 10,000 options. Or looking at your phone—47 apps, 1,200 photos you've never looked at twice, 83 unread messages.

You have so much. So much access, so much stuff, so much information, so much... everything.

And you're empty.

The chapter opens with this paradox: abundance that feels like poverty. Excess that creates hunger. The strange exhaustion of having "too much of a good thing."

Paint a specific scene: Maybe it's Thanksgiving dinner. The table's loaded—turkey, stuffing, three kinds of pie. Everyone's laughing, grateful, feasting. And you're sitting there, plate full, feeling hollow. You should be grateful. You are grateful, in your head. But in your gut, you're starving for something this feast can't feed.

Or it's Christmas morning. Presents everywhere. You bought gifts for everyone on your list, went into debt doing it, felt pressure to match last year's generosity. The kids are squealing, paper's flying, and you're wondering why this doesn't feel like "peace on earth" anymore.

Or it's a Friday night. Your calendar is packed—work, church, kids' activities, side hustles, social commitments. You're productive, successful, busy. And you're dying inside.

**Key Themes (4-5 pages):**

**1. The Insatiable Appetite of the Human Heart**

There's a reason Jesus talked so much about money, possessions, and wealth. Not because they're evil, but because they promise satisfaction they cannot deliver.

Explore the hunger that drives us:

- We consume because we ache
- We acquire because we fear scarcity (of things, of love, of worth)
- We grasp because we don't know how to receive
- We hoard because we don't trust there will be enough

Tell a personal story: Maybe a season of your life when you had everything you thought you wanted—the job, the relationship, the success, the platform—and still woke up feeling empty. The confusion of that. The shame of it. "I should be happy. Why aren't I happy?"

Or the opposite: the hustle for more. More followers, more opportunities, more recognition. The lie that whispered: "Just a little more and then you'll be satisfied." But the goalposts kept moving.

**2. Why "More" Never Satisfies**

This is Ecclesiastes territory. "Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income" (Ecclesiastes 5:10).

Unpack the psychology and theology:

- **The hedonic treadmill:** We adapt to each new level of abundance and immediately want more.
- **The God-shaped hole:** Augustine was right—our hearts are restless until they rest in God. We try to fill that hole with everything else.
- **The comparison trap:** Social media has weaponized this. We're constantly seeing someone who has more, is doing more, looks better.
- **The scarcity mindset:** Even in abundance, we fear lack. So we grasp, hoard, protect.

Connect this to spiritual formation: We do the same thing with spiritual experiences. We want more—more powerful worship moments, more dramatic answered prayers, more evidence that God is real. And when we don't get it, we feel spiritually poor even if we're theologically rich.

**3. The Difference Between God's Abundance and Our Greed**

This is crucial: The Bible celebrates abundance. God's creation is extravagant. Jesus' first miracle was turning water into wine—the best wine, at a party that had already been drinking. The Father in the Prodigal Son story throws a lavish feast. The New Testament uses feast imagery constantly.

God isn't stingy. God is generous.

But there's a massive difference between **receiving abundance as gift** and **grasping at abundance as possession**.

Create a chart or comparison:

| **Gift** | **Possession** |
|----------|----------------|
| Held with open hands | Clutched with white knuckles |
| Received with gratitude | Acquired with anxiety |
| Shared freely | Hoarded fearfully |
| Produces joy | Produces stress |
| Enough is enough | Enough is never enough |

**4. Learning the Difference Between Gift and Possession**

Tell the story of how you learned this (or are learning it):

Maybe it was the moment you realized your music career had become an idol. Music is a gift from God, but you'd made it your identity, your worth, your god. And it was crushing you.

Or it was the realization that your need for approval—even good approval, ministry approval—was insatiable. You'd built a platform, a following, a ministry. People were blessed. Lives were changed. But you were empty because you'd turned a gift into a possession, a calling into an identity.

**Biblical Parallels (3-4 pages):**

**The Israelites Hoarding Manna (Exodus 16):**

Tell this story slowly, with detail. Israel's been rescued from Egypt, they're in the wilderness, and they're hungry. God provides manna—bread from heaven, every morning. It's a miracle. Daily provision.

But God gives specific instructions: Take only what you need for today. Trust me to provide tomorrow.

Some of the Israelites can't do it. They hoard. They take extra "just in case." And what happens? It rots. It breeds worms. It stinks.

The lesson: When you try to possess what's meant to be received as gift, it rots.

Connect this to our lives: We do this with money (hoarding instead of trusting), with time (over-scheduling because we fear missing out), with relationships (clinging instead of loving freely), with our gifts (grasping our platform, our success, our identity).

**The Rich Young Ruler (Mark 10:17-22):**

This story breaks my heart every time. A man comes running to Jesus—literally running, full of eagerness—and asks, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

Jesus walks him through the commandments. The man says, "I've kept all these since I was a boy."

And the text says, "Jesus looked at him and loved him."

Pause there. Jesus loved him. This isn't a story about Jesus being harsh. It's a story about Jesus loving someone enough to tell the truth.

Jesus says, "One thing you lack. Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."

And the man walks away sad, "because he had great wealth."

Unpack this:
- Jesus wasn't condemning wealth. He was diagnosing possession.
- The man's wealth wasn't the problem. His attachment to it was.
- Jesus was inviting him to freedom—open hands, trust, following—but he couldn't let go.
- The tragedy: He had everything but the one thing, and he chose everything over the One Thing.

Ask the reader: What's your "great wealth"? What's the thing Jesus might be asking you to hold loosely, and you're walking away sad because you can't?

**Jesus Feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14:13-21):**

Here's abundance rightly ordered. A crowd of thousands, hungry, far from town. The disciples panic: "Send them away to buy food."

Jesus says, "You give them something to eat."

They respond: "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish."

**Only.** That word tells you everything about their mindset. Scarcity. Not enough.

But Jesus takes what they have, gives thanks, breaks it, and feeds the multitude. Not just enough—abundance. Twelve baskets of leftovers.

The lesson: When you give what you have to Jesus, trusting Him to multiply it, there's always more than enough. But you have to give it. You have to let go.

**Theological Anchor (2 pages):**

**Ecclesiastes 5:10** - "Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless."

But don't stop there. Read Ecclesiastes 5:18-20:

"This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God."

The problem isn't abundance. The problem is trying to find satisfaction in abundance instead of in God.

When you receive abundance as gift from God and enjoy it in God, it satisfies. When you grasp abundance as identity, security, or savior, it never will.

**The Wayfarer Moment (1-2 pages):**

**Admitting that even good things become idols when we use them to avoid God.**

This is painful territory. Because we're not talking about obviously bad things. We're talking about good things:
- Work
- Success
- Relationships
- Platform
- Influence
- Even ministry

The question isn't "Is this thing bad?" The question is "Am I using this thing to avoid dealing with the ache inside me that only God can touch?"

Tell a story of your own idol-smashing moment. The thing you thought was your calling, your purpose, your mission—and you realized you'd made it your god.

Maybe it was music. God gave you a gift, and you turned it into your identity. And when the music wasn't going well, you weren't okay. When people didn't respond to a song, you felt worthless. The gift had become an idol.

The wayfarer moment is recognizing: I can love this thing, but I can't need this thing to tell me who I am. Only God gets to do that.

**Song Integration (2-3 pages):**

**Full lyrics to "Too Much of a Good Thing"**

Then tell the story. Maybe:

"I wrote this song after a particularly successful season. Outwardly, everything was working. The songs were connecting, the shows were full, the opportunities were coming. I should have been grateful. I was grateful.

But I was also terrified. Because I'd built my sense of self on the success. And I knew—deep down, I knew—that if the success went away, I'd crumble. I'd made an idol out of a gift.

This song was my confession. And my prayer. 'God, I don't know how to want You more than I want this. Teach me. Even if it costs me everything.'"

**Reflections for the Road (1-2 pages):**

- What "good things" have you been using to fill the God-shaped hole?
- Where in your life are you clutching instead of receiving?
- What would it look like to hold your greatest gift with open hands?
- If Jesus asked you, like the rich young ruler, to let go of the one thing—what would it be? And would you walk away sad?

**Practice: The Open-Handed Prayer**

Sit quietly. Hold your hands in front of you, palms up, open.

Name the things you've been grasping: success, approval, security, relationships, gifts, platforms.

With each one, imagine placing it in your open hands. Not throwing it away. Not pretending it doesn't matter. Just... opening your hands.

Pray: "God, this is Yours. I receive it as gift. I hold it loosely. Teach me to want You more."

**Closing Image:**

Open hands. The beginning of surrender—not having less, but holding loosely. Not poverty, but freedom. Not scarcity, but trust.

You're still in the swamp, but your hands are opening. And that's the first step toward grace.

**Length:** 13-15 pages
