## Key Themes

- Grace meets us in the mess, not after we clean up
- Performance-based faith leads to burnout
- Honesty is the first language of grace
- The journey isn't linear—we're all wayfarers
- Good things become idols when used to avoid God
- Unforced rhythms replace striving and exhaustion
- Community holds us when we can't hold ourselves
- Nothing is wasted in the economy of grace

---

## Notes for Collaborators

- Files are formatted in Markdown for easy editing
- Each chapter follows a consistent structure (see any chapter file for pattern)
- Songs are integral, not decorative—they carry emotional weight
- Maintain raw, honest, poetic tone throughout
- Use story before doctrine; theology emerges from narrative
- Keep paragraphs short, pacing varied, white space generous
