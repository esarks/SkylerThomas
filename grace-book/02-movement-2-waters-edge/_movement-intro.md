## MOVEMENT 2: AT THE WATER'S EDGE (The Turning)

*Interlude (3-4 pages):*

You've left the swamp.

It wasn't easy. Maybe you're still looking back over your shoulder, wondering if you made the right choice. Your feet are heavy with swamp mud. Your clothes are soaked, clinging to you. You smell like the muck you just escaped.

But you're here. At the water's edge.

This is liminal space. The in-between. Not swamp anymore, but not healed yet. Not drowning, but not dancing. Not death, but not resurrection. Not Friday, not Sunday.

This is Saturday. Tomb time. Transition.

The water's edge is where grace does its most subversive work.

You want to clean yourself up before you step into the water. You're embarrassed by the mud, the stench, the evidence of where you've been. Surely God wants you to get yourself together first, right?

Wrong.

Grace says: Come as you are. Mud and all. Shame and all. Questions and all.

The water isn't there to judge you. It's there to wash you.

But here's the hard part: You have to let yourself be washed. You have to get in the water. You have to let grace touch the wounds.

And that's terrifying.

Because what if you're too dirty? What if the water rejects you? What if grace has limits and you've exceeded them?

These chapters—6 through 9—are about discovering the answer to those fears. And the answer is always the same: Grace is deeper than your shame. Wider than your failure. Stronger than your sin. More persistent than your doubt.

At the water's edge, you're going to encounter Jesus in new ways:
- As the Living Water that quenches thirst you didn't know how to name
- As the shadow that covers and protects
- As the grace that finds you before you find it
- As the invitation to dig deeper, to go beneath the surface

You're going to learn what the Samaritan woman learned at the well: Jesus offers water that becomes a spring welling up to eternal life (John 4:14).

You're going to learn what the psalmist knew: God is shelter, refuge, fortress (Psalm 91).

You're going to learn what the old hymn declares: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me (and you).

These aren't abstract theological concepts. They're water on your parched tongue. Shade on your scorched skin. Arms that hold you when you collapse. Truth that sets you free.

The water's edge is where you stop running from God and start running to God.

Where you stop hiding and start being found.

Where you stop performing and start receiving.

This is the turning. The hinge of your story. The moment when the narrative shifts from "I can't" to "God can." From "I'm too far gone" to "Grace reaches farther."

So stand here. At the edge. Feel the coolness of the water lapping at your toes. Hear the invitation: Come. Drink. Be washed. Be healed. Be made new.

You don't have to have it all together. You don't have to understand it all. You just have to wade in.

The water's not going to hurt you. It's going to heal you.

One step at a time.
