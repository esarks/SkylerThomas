### Chapter 7: In the Shadow of Your Grace
**Based on:** "In the Shadow of Your Grace (Devotional and Song)"

**Opening Poem:**

In the Shadow of Your Grace

What can wash away my shame,
Or will I live forever in its grip,
Squeezing the very life out of my soul,
Leaving me to rot on the heap of humanity?

Have I walked too far beyond the boundary of grace,
Only to look back and see nothing but emptiness,
Leaving me to fend for myself in this world,
Sliding faster and faster to death and destruction?

But then I stop. I don't move in any direction.
I bow down and listen.

And I hear Your voice—just the whisper of Your voice—
Pleading with me to return, to simply turn around and walk.

And so I did turn. I took one step, just one step.
I heard You say, "Give Me your burden, and I will take care of you."

How do I trust after all these years?
My shame is great, my faith is weak, and I'm tired.
I heard You say, "Come to Me, and I will give you rest."

**Opening Scene (2-3 pages):** Describe a scorching desert day, finding shade, the relief and protection of shadow—contrasted with the spiritual "scorching" of life

**Key Themes (5-6 pages):**
1. Grace as shelter and protection, not escape
2. The difference between hiding FROM God vs hiding IN God
3. Psalm 91 theology—dwelling in the shelter
4. Shadow as evidence of light (theological richness)
5. Learning to rest under God's covering during trials
6. Resting in the mystery of God

Someone asked me once: "The mystery of God—is it ours to figure out, or to revere?"

In the shadow of grace, we learn it's the latter. We don't have to understand everything. We don't have to have God figured out. We just have to know we're covered, sheltered, held.

The shadow proves there's light. And where there's light, there's the One who is Light.

**Biblical Parallels (3-4 pages):**
- Ruth under Boaz's wing (Ruth 2:12)
- Israelites under the cloud by day (Exodus 13:21)
- Jesus longing to gather Jerusalem like a hen gathers chicks (Matthew 23:37)
- Psalm 91 (deep dive)

**Theological Anchor:** Psalm 91:1-2
**Wayfarer Moment:** Grace doesn't promise no suffering; it promises no suffering alone
**Song Integration (2-3 pages)**
**Reflections + Practice**
**Length:** 13-15 pages
