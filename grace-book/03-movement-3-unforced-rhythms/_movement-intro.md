## MOVEMENT 3: UNFORCED RHYTHMS (The Transformation)

*Interlude (3-4 pages):*

A breath. A shift. The water's edge is behind now. You're clean—or at least, being cleaned. The process continues, but something fundamental has changed.

You're learning to swim. Better yet—you're learning to float.

[Expand with poetic reflections on transformation as ongoing process, the shift from striving to surrender, introducing the concept of "unforced rhythms" as the way of sustainable grace]
