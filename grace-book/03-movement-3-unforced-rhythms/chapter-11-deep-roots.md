### Chapter 11: Deep Roots, Strong Growth
**Based on:** "Deep Roots, Strong Growth (Devotional and Song)"

**The Work of Deep Roots:**

Deep roots require putting to death what doesn't belong:
- Pride (the need to be right, to prove ourselves)
- Reactivity (responding from wounds instead of from identity)
- Isolation (the temptation to withdraw when things get hard)
- Bitterness (the nursing of perceived injustices)

And deep roots require cultivating what does belong:
- Humility (acknowledging our need for grace)
- Responsiveness (acting from our true self, not our wounded self)
- Connection (staying engaged even when vulnerable)
- Forgiveness (releasing what we can't control)

This is how roots go deepâ€”not by addition, but by transformation.

[Full expansion: organic growth metaphors, Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17:7-8, patience with process, hidden work of God, fruit that comes from deep roots]

**Length:** 13-15 pages
