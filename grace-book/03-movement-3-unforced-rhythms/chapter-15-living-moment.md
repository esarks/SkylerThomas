### Chapter 15: Living in the Moment
**Based on:** "Living in the Moment"

**Life as a Loan:**

Someone wrote: "My life is a loan given by God, and I will give it back with interest."

This is the heart of living in the moment. Not grasping at life as if it's ours to possess, but receiving each moment as a gift to steward. Not anxiously planning every future contingency, but investing today's grace into today's calling.

Living in the moment doesn't mean ignoring tomorrow. It means trusting that today's faithfulness is the best preparation for tomorrow's challenges.

**Fixing Your Eyes:**

Fixing your eyes.

Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what others have or what might go wrong.
Not backward eyes that live in regret.
Not anxious eyes that strain to see the distant future.

Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment. On the grace that's present right now.

"Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith" (Hebrews 12:1-2).

The race is now. The moment is here. Fix your eyes.

**Practices for Living in the Moment:**

1. Compassion Meditation: Spend time daily bringing to mind people in your life and praying for their well-being. Let compassion anchor you in the present.

2. Commit Acts of Kindness: Small, intentional acts done today create present-moment connection and meaning.

3. Count Your Blessings Weekly: Once a week, write down specific things you're grateful for from the past seven days. This trains your eyes to see grace in the ordinary.
