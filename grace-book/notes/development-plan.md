  - Practical helpfulness

### Phase 6: Refinement (1-2 months)

Based on feedback:

## Conclusion

This book is for the bedraggled, beat-up, and burnt out. For the wayfarers who know they need grace but aren't sure it's for them. This book says: **It is. Grace is for you. Right here. Right now. Swamp mud and all.**

It's a book that could only be written by someone who's been in the swamp. Who's stood at the water's edge, terrified and hopeful. Who's learning—still learning—the unforced rhythms of grace.

It's a book with a soundtrack, because some truths can only be sung.

It's a book for the journey, because we're all still on the road.

And it's a book of hope—not the cheap kind that pretends everything's fine, but the deep kind that says: **Grace goes deeper than your shame. Grace reaches farther than your failure. Grace is real. And it's for wayfarers like us.**

Welcome to the journey.
