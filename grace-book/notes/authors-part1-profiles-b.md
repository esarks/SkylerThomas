## 8. THOMAS À KEMPIS (1380-1471)

### Biographical Context

Thomas à Kempis was born in the small German town of Kempen (hence "à Kempis" - "of Kempen"). His birth name was Thomas Hemerken. He lived during a tumultuous period in Christian history—the late Middle Ages, marked by plague, war, corruption in the church, and growing calls for reform that would eventually lead to the Protestant Reformation.

At age thirteen, Thomas was sent to Deventer in the Netherlands to study at a school run by the Brethren of the Common Life, a movement emphasizing practical piety, personal devotion, and imitation of Christ over scholastic theology. This movement, called the Devotio Moderna ("Modern Devotion"), profoundly shaped Thomas's spirituality. It emphasized inward religion—the cultivation of personal relationship with God through meditation, prayer, and moral living.

In 1399, Thomas entered the Augustinian monastery of Mount St. Agnes near Zwolle, Netherlands, where his brother John was prior. He spent the next seventy years there, rarely leaving the monastery. He was ordained a priest in 1413 and served as sub-prior for a time, but mostly lived in quiet obscurity—copying manuscripts, writing spiritual treatises, and counseling those who sought his wisdom.

Thomas died in 1471 at age 91, having lived almost his entire adult life within the same monastery walls. He wrote numerous works, but one stands above all others: "The Imitation of Christ," which became the most widely read Christian book after the Bible for several centuries.

### Major Works Overview

**"The Imitation of Christ" (c. 1418-1427)** - This is Thomas's masterwork and one of the most influential Christian books ever written. It's divided into four books:

- **Book 1: "Useful Admonitions for the Spiritual Life"** - Focuses on the inner life, detachment from worldly things, humility, and reading Scripture for transformation rather than knowledge.

- **Book 2: "Admonitions Drawing One Toward the Inner Life"** - Explores finding God in solitude, maintaining a good conscience, loving Jesus above all, and the joy of a pure heart.

- **Book 3: "On Inward Consolation"** - A dialogue between Christ and the soul. Christ speaks words of comfort, guidance, and challenge. Themes include suffering, trust, self-surrender, and the path to peace.

- **Book 4: "On the Blessed Sacrament"** - Meditations on the Eucharist as spiritual nourishment and means of grace.

The book's genius is its simplicity. Thomas doesn't engage in complex theological arguments. He writes in short, pithy chapters (often just 1-2 pages) that can be read devotionally. His prose is clear, direct, and deeply biblical. The work has been translated into more languages than any Christian book except the Bible and has never been out of print since its first publication.

**Other writings** - Thomas wrote numerous other devotional works, biblical commentaries, biographies of saints, and letters of spiritual direction. Most are known only to scholars. But "The Imitation of Christ" alone secured his place among Christianity's most influential voices.

### Core Theological Positions

**Imitation of Christ as the Christian Life**: For Thomas, Christianity isn't primarily about believing the right doctrines or participating in religious rituals (though these matter). It's about imitating Jesus—conforming our lives to His pattern of humility, self-denial, love, and obedience to the Father. He writes: "What good does it do to speak learnedly about the Trinity if, lacking humility, you displease the Trinity? Truly, lofty words do not make a person holy and just; but a virtuous life makes one dear to God."

**Inward Religion over Outward Performance**: Thomas lived in an era of external religious observance—pilgrimages, relics, elaborate ceremonies. While not rejecting these, he insisted that inward transformation is primary. "At the Day of Judgment we shall not be asked what we have read, but what we have done; not how well we have spoken, but how religiously we have lived." This resonates with Jesus's critique of the Pharisees and with Reformation emphasis on heart transformation.

**Detachment from the World**: Thomas calls for detachment—not hatred of creation, but freedom from being controlled by created things. He writes: "First keep the peace within yourself, then you can also bring peace to others." This isn't ascetic punishment; it's recognizing that attachment to temporal things creates anxiety and robs us of peace. Only in God do we find rest.

**Grace and Human Effort**: Thomas holds these in tension. He emphasizes human responsibility (prayer, self-discipline, moral effort) while acknowledging that transformation comes only by grace. "Without the Way, there is no going; without the Truth, there is no knowing; without the Life, there is no living. I am the Way which you must follow; the Truth which you must believe; the Life for which you must hope."

**Suffering as Formation**: Thomas sees suffering not as meaningless but as conforming us to Christ, who suffered. "If you cannot bear a little suffering, how will you endure eternal torment? If a little suffering makes you impatient now, what will hell fire do later?" He's not glorifying suffering, but recognizing its inevitability and potential to deepen faith.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"First keep the peace within yourself, then you can also bring peace to others."**
- **"What good does it do to speak learnedly about the Trinity if, lacking humility, you displease the Trinity?"**
- **"Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong, patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never seeking its own."**
- **"Without the Way, there is no going; without the Truth, there is no knowing; without the Life, there is no living."**
- **"If you cannot bear a little suffering now, how will you endure eternal torment?"**
- **"At the Day of Judgment we shall not be asked what we have read, but what we have done."**
- **"Wait a little, and you will see great things."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Thomas's seventy years in the monastery gave him deep experience of the contemplative life. He knew firsthand the struggles he wrote about: the temptation to pride in spiritual accomplishments, the difficulty of sustained prayer, the loneliness of the soul seeking God, the battle with wandering thoughts and lukewarm devotion.

His obscurity is significant. He never sought fame, never led a movement, never held high church office. He remained a simple monk, faithfully copying manuscripts and writing for the benefit of his fellow monks and those seeking spiritual counsel. This humility authenticates his message—he practiced what he preached.

The monastic context explains some emphases (solitude, detachment from worldly affairs, frequent communion) that don't translate directly to lay Christian life. Yet the core themes—intimacy with Christ, inward transformation, humility, perseverance in suffering—are universally applicable. Thomas wrote for monks, but his words have nourished Christians in every walk of life for six centuries.

His longevity (91 years in an age when life expectancy was much shorter) and constancy (seventy years in the same place, same rhythm) model the patient, steady faithfulness he advocates. He wasn't a flashy convert or dramatic personality. He was a faithful wayfarer who walked with Christ daily for decades, and his writing distills that long obedience into timeless wisdom.

## 9. ST. AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO (354-430)

### Biographical Context

Augustine was born in Thagaste, North Africa (modern-day Algeria), to a pagan father (Patricius) and a devout Christian mother (Monica). His early life was marked by intellectual brilliance and moral chaos. He studied rhetoric, pursuing a career as an orator and teacher. But he also pursued pleasure—he had a long-term mistress with whom he fathered a son (Adeodatus), and he lived a dissolute life.

Spiritually, Augustine searched restlessly. He joined the Manicheans (a dualistic sect), hoping to find truth. He studied philosophy, particularly Neoplatonism. His mother Monica prayed for his conversion for years, often with tears. Augustine recounts how a bishop told her: "The child of so many tears will not perish."

The turning point came in Milan, where Augustine was teaching rhetoric. He heard the preaching of Bishop Ambrose and was intellectually convinced of Christianity's credibility. But his will remained enslaved to lust and pride. The famous conversion scene is recorded in his "Confessions": sitting in a garden, tormented by inner conflict, he heard a child's voice singing "Tolle lege, tolle lege" ("Take up and read"). He opened Paul's letter to the Romans and read: "Not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires" (Romans 13:13-14). In that moment, he was converted.

Augustine was baptized by Ambrose in 387. He returned to North Africa, was ordained a priest in 391, and became Bishop of Hippo in 395—a position he held until his death in 430. As bishop, he was pastor, theologian, writer, and defender of orthodoxy against various heresies (Donatism, Pelagianism, Manichaeism).

He died as Vandals besieged Hippo, an old man watching the world he knew collapse. But his theological legacy shaped Western Christianity more than any other figure except Paul. His influence spans Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants—Luther and Calvin both saw themselves as Augustinians.

### Major Works Overview

**"Confessions" (c. 397-400)** - One of the first autobiographies in Western literature and certainly the first spiritual autobiography. Augustine recounts his life from infancy to his mother's death, focusing on his spiritual journey. It's addressed to God in prayer form, making it simultaneously autobiography, theology, and devotion.

The famous opening captures its spirit: "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you." Book 1-9 are biographical; Book 10 explores memory, temptation, and the present state of his soul; Books 11-13 are extended theological meditations on Genesis 1.

**"City of God" (413-426)** - A massive work (22 books) written in response to the sack of Rome by Visigoths in 410. Pagans blamed Christianity for weakening Rome; Augustine responds by contrasting two cities: the City of God (those who love God) and the City of Man (those who love self). He traces this conflict through history from creation to final judgment.

It's part philosophy of history, part apologetics, part political theology. Augustine argues that earthly kingdoms rise and fall, but God's kingdom is eternal. Christians are citizens of the heavenly city, living as pilgrims in the earthly city.

**"On Christian Doctrine" (begun 396, completed 426)** - A handbook on biblical interpretation and Christian education. Augustine addresses how to read Scripture, what to do when interpretations conflict, and how to preach and teach effectively. His principle: "Love God and do what you will" doesn't mean license, but that if you truly love God, your will aligns with His.

**Anti-Pelagian Writings** - Pelagius taught that humans can choose good without grace—that we're morally neutral and can save ourselves through effort. Augustine vehemently opposed this, arguing that sin has corrupted human nature so deeply that we cannot choose God without His grace enabling us. These debates shaped Western theology's understanding of original sin, grace, predestination, and free will.

### Core Theological Positions

**Restless Hearts**: Augustine's most famous line encapsulates his theology: "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you." Humans were created for God. Sin is misdirected desire—loving created things more than the Creator. We're inherently restless because we're seeking satisfaction in things that can't ultimately satisfy. Only God can fill the God-shaped hole in our hearts.

**Grace as Necessary**: Against Pelagius, Augustine argued that human nature is so corrupted by sin that we cannot choose God or do good without grace. "Free will" in a fallen state is only free to sin. True freedom—freedom to choose God and good—comes only through grace regenerating the will. This doesn't negate human responsibility, but it means salvation is entirely God's work. We contribute nothing but our sin; God contributes everything in redemption.

**Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**: Augustine held both truths in tension (though often leaning heavily on sovereignty). God predestines some to salvation (election), yet humans are genuinely responsible for their choices. How these fit together is a mystery Augustine acknowledged but didn't fully resolve. This tension runs through all subsequent Reformed theology.

**Love as Central**: For Augustine, the Christian life is about rightly ordered loves. We're commanded to love God supremely and neighbor as ourselves. Sin is disordered love—loving self above God, loving temporal things above eternal. The moral life isn't about rule-keeping; it's about cultivating right loves. "Love God and do what you will" means: if you truly love God, your will aligns with His, and your actions flow from that love.

**Sacraments as Means of Grace**: Augustine developed sacramental theology that influenced both Catholics and Protestants. Baptism and Eucharist are more than symbols—they're means by which God communicates grace. But they're effective only when received in faith. The sacrament doesn't automatically save; it's God working through physical means to convey spiritual reality.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."**
- **"Love God and do what you will."**
- **"Give what you command, and command what you will."**
- **"Our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee."**
- **"To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement."**
- **"Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe."**
- **"The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Augustine's pre-conversion life gives him credibility when he writes about sin, lust, pride, and spiritual restlessness. He's not a sheltered religious person condemning sins he doesn't understand. He lived them. His "Confessions" is brutally honest about his sexual sin, his manipulation of others, his intellectual pride. This makes his testimony of grace compelling—if God can save Augustine, God can save anyone.

His relationship with Monica shows the power of persistent prayer. She prayed for decades before seeing his conversion. This taught Augustine that God's timing isn't ours, and that faithful intercession matters. It also shaped his theology of grace—Monica couldn't convert Augustine through nagging or manipulation; only God could change his heart.

Augustine's pastoral work in Hippo grounded his theology in real life. He wasn't just a theorist; he was shepherding actual people through actual struggles. His sermons (hundreds survive) show a pastor who knew his flock, spoke plainly, and applied theology to daily life.

His context—the crumbling Roman Empire—shaped "City of God." Christians were tempted to despair: if Rome could fall, what hope is there? Augustine's answer: your hope was never in Rome. Your citizenship is in the City of God, which cannot fall. This gave Christians a framework for living faithfully in a collapsing world—a message relevant in every age of cultural decline.

## 10. RICHARD J. FOSTER (1942– )

### Biographical Context

Richard Foster grew up in a small Quaker community, shaped by the Friends' tradition of simplicity, silence, and hearing God's voice. He studied at George Fox University and later earned a doctorate in theology from Fuller Seminary. His calling has been to recover ancient spiritual practices for modern Christians.

Foster's breakthrough came in 1978 with the publication of "Celebration of Discipline," which introduced evangelicals (who often emphasized conversion and Bible study but neglected spiritual disciplines) to practices like meditation, fasting, solitude, simplicity, and contemplative prayer. The book sold millions of copies and sparked a renewal of interest in spiritual formation.

In 1988, Foster founded Renovaré (Latin for "renewal"), a ministry dedicated to helping Christians integrate the streams of Christian tradition (contemplative, holiness, charismatic, social justice, evangelical, incarnational) into a balanced spiritual life. Renovaré offers resources, conferences, and a spiritual formation curriculum.

Foster's contribution is bridge-building. He draws from Catholic mystics, Protestant reformers, Quaker silence, charismatic worship, and monastic practices, showing that the whole church's wisdom is available to all Christians. He's helped evangelicals overcome suspicion of "Catholic" practices and helped mainline Protestants recover disciplines they'd lost.

### Major Works Overview

**"Celebration of Discipline" (1978)** - Foster's classic work on spiritual disciplines. He organizes them into three categories:

- **Inward Disciplines**: Meditation, prayer, fasting, study. These shape the inner life, cultivating intimacy with God and transformation of character.

- **Outward Disciplines**: Simplicity, solitude, submission, service. These govern our relationship with the world, freeing us from bondage to possessions, status, and selfish ambition.

- **Corporate Disciplines**: Confession, worship, guidance, celebration. These are practiced in community, recognizing that we grow together, not just individually.

Foster's central claim: grace is free, but growth requires discipline. Disciplines don't earn God's favor; they position us to receive His transforming grace. He uses the analogy of a farmer: the farmer can't make crops grow, but he can plow, plant, water, and weed—creating conditions for growth. Spiritual disciplines create conditions for the Spirit's work.

**"Prayer: Finding the Heart's True Home" (1992)** - An exploration of 21 forms of prayer drawn from Christian tradition: simple prayer, prayer of tears, prayer of examen, prayer of relinquishment, unceasing prayer, etc. Foster's genius is making diverse practices accessible. He doesn't just describe; he invites readers to practice. Each chapter ends with practical guidance: "Try this..."

**"Streams of Living Water" (2001)** - Foster identifies six "streams" of Christian tradition, each emphasizing a facet of faith:
  1. Contemplative (prayer, intimacy with God)
  2. Holiness (virtue, purity of heart)
  3. Charismatic (Spirit-empowerment, worship)
  4. Social Justice (compassion, advocacy for the poor and oppressed)
  5. Evangelical (Scripture, proclaiming the gospel)
  6. Incarnational (sacramental life, God's presence in the physical world)

He argues that a fully formed Christian life draws from all six streams. We tend to camp in one or two, neglecting others, resulting in unbalanced spirituality.

**"Freedom of Simplicity" (1981)** - An exploration of the spiritual discipline of simplicity. Foster distinguishes between poverty (forced lack) and simplicity (chosen freedom from consumerism's bondage). He addresses practical areas: finances, possessions, speech, time. The goal isn't asceticism but freedom—living uncluttered lives focused on God and neighbor.

### Core Theological Positions

**Spiritual Disciplines as Means of Grace**: Foster reclaims "discipline" from legalism. Disciplines aren't laws to keep or hoops to jump through. They're practices that open us to God's transforming grace. We can't change ourselves, but we can place ourselves where God can change us. Dallas Willard (Foster's close friend) said: "Grace is not opposed to effort; it's opposed to earning." Foster embodies this.

**Integration of Christian Traditions**: Foster refuses to pit traditions against each other. Protestants can learn from Catholic mystics. Evangelicals can practice contemplative prayer. Charismatics can embrace liturgy. This integration enriches everyone, drawing on 2000 years of wisdom rather than just the last 50 years of our particular tribe's experience.

**Interior Life and Social Action**: Foster holds these together. Contemplation without action becomes escapism; action without contemplation becomes burnout or activism disconnected from God. "The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people." Depth comes through the inward disciplines; fruitfulness in the world flows from that depth.

**Kingdom of God as Present and Future**: Foster emphasizes that God's kingdom is breaking into the present, not just a future hope. We can experience kingdom realities—peace, joy, healing, justice—now through the Spirit's work. The disciplines help us live into that kingdom reality rather than being conformed to the broken patterns of the world.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"Spiritual disciplines are not a way to earn God's favor but a way to position ourselves to receive His grace."**
- **"Superficiality is the curse of our age. The doctrine of instant satisfaction is a primary spiritual problem. The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people."**
- **"In contemporary society our Adversary majors in three things: noise, hurry, and crowds. If he can keep us engaged in 'muchness' and 'manyness,' he will rest satisfied."**
- **"The classical Disciplines of the spiritual life call us to move beyond surface living into the depths."**
- **"Our ordinary lives can become prayer."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Foster's Quaker background gave him appreciation for silence, simplicity, and listening for God's voice. But he didn't remain insular; he studied broadly, drawing from Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Anabaptist sources. This breadth makes him a trustworthy guide across traditions.

His academic work (doctorate from Fuller) grounds his writing in solid theology. He's not offering pop psychology or self-help spirituality; he's recovering historic Christian practices validated by centuries of use. This scholarly foundation gives his work credibility.

Foster's partnership with Dallas Willard (they were close friends and collaborators) enriched both men's work. Willard brought philosophical rigor and psychological insight; Foster brought pastoral warmth and ecumenical breadth. Together, they've shaped a generation of Christians seeking deeper spiritual formation.

His founding of Renovaré shows commitment to practical application. He doesn't just write books; he's created resources, communities, and curricula to help people actually practice spiritual disciplines. This practitioner's heart keeps his writing grounded and accessible.

## 11. DALLAS WILLARD (1935-2013)

### Biographical Context

Dallas Willard was a philosopher by profession (he taught at University of Southern California for 47 years) and a spiritual formation teacher by calling. Born in Missouri, raised in rural poverty, he earned a PhD in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His academic specialty was phenomenology—particularly the work of Edmund Husserl.

But Willard lived a dual vocation. In the academy, he was a rigorous philosopher, publishing scholarly works on logic, philosophy of mind, and phenomenology. In the church, he was a gentle revolutionary, calling Christians to recover Jesus's teachings on discipleship and transformation.

Willard's key insight: Western Christianity had separated salvation (getting into heaven) from discipleship (following Jesus). Churches focused on getting people converted but offered little guidance on actually living like Jesus. The result: millions of Christians who are "saved" but whose lives don't look noticeably different from non-Christians.

Willard spent decades developing a vision of discipleship as apprenticeship to Jesus—learning from Him how to live life as He would if He were in our place. This isn't about earning salvation (grace remains free) but about the transformation Jesus intended for those who follow Him.

He wrote several influential books, taught at conferences globally, and mentored thousands through his gentle, humble presence. Despite his philosophical brilliance, he spoke plainly, making profound truths accessible. He died in 2013 at age 77, leaving a legacy of calling the church back to Jesus's vision of life in the kingdom of God.

### Major Works Overview

**"The Divine Conspiracy" (1998)** - Willard's magnum opus, subtitled "Rediscovering Our Hidden Life in God." He argues that Jesus's central message was the availability of the kingdom of God—a different way of living, empowered by God's presence, available now to all who trust Jesus.

Willard critiques what he calls "the gospel of sin management"—the reduction of Christianity to forgiveness of sins for heaven after death, with little attention to transformation in this life. He reclaims the Sermon on the Mount (often dismissed as impossible ideals) as practical training for kingdom living.

The book is structured around Jesus's teachings in Matthew 5-7, showing how they describe life in God's kingdom. Willard argues that Jesus's "hard sayings" are actually easier than the world's way—it's easier to live without lust than to manage its consequences; easier to live without anxiety than to bear its weight.

**"Renovation of the Heart" (2002)** - A systematic approach to spiritual transformation. Willard explores how transformation happens in six dimensions of human life: thought, feeling, will, body, social relationships, and soul. He argues that we become like Jesus by training these aspects through spiritual disciplines, empowered by grace.

Key insight: "You can't do what Jesus did or be like Jesus by trying harder. You need a plan—a plan that involves practices that position you to receive God's transforming grace." The book outlines that plan in detail.

**"The Spirit of the Disciplines" (1988)** - Willard's first major work on spiritual formation, laying groundwork for later books. He examines Jesus's own life, noting that Jesus practiced spiritual disciplines (solitude, fasting, prayer, study of Scripture). If Jesus needed disciplines to live in God's power, how much more do we?

Willard categorizes disciplines as disciplines of abstinence (fasting, solitude, silence, frugality, chastity, secrecy, sacrifice) and disciplines of engagement (study, worship, celebration, service, prayer, fellowship, confession, submission). Both types are necessary for balanced growth.

**"Hearing God" (1999)** - Addresses how God communicates with His people today. Willard argues that God still speaks—not through new revelations that contradict Scripture, but through the Holy Spirit guiding, prompting, and illuminating truth. He offers practical guidance on discerning God's voice from other voices (self, culture, enemy).

### Core Theological Positions

**Kingdom of God as Present Reality**: Willard's central theme is that the kingdom of God—God's effective will, His reign—is available now, not just in the future. Jesus's message wasn't "Get saved so you can go to heaven when you die" (though that's included). It was "Repent [rethink everything], for the kingdom of heaven is at hand [within reach, available now]." We can live in God's reality, under His rule, empowered by His presence, starting today.

**Discipleship as Apprenticeship**: Willard redefines discipleship. It's not primarily about believing correct doctrines or attending church (though these matter). It's apprenticeship—learning from Jesus how to live life as He would if He were in your place. A disciple is "one who is learning from Jesus how to live the life He would live if He were I." This makes discipleship intensely practical and applicable to every area of life.

**Grace and Effort**: Willard's famous line: "Grace is not opposed to effort; it's opposed to earning." Transformation requires effort—spiritual disciplines, training, practice. But effort doesn't earn God's favor; it positions us to receive His transforming grace. It's like physical training: you can't grow muscles by wishing; you have to work out. But it's grace (biological processes beyond your control) that actually builds the muscle. Similarly, spiritual disciplines don't change us directly; they position us where God can change us.

**VIM: Vision, Intention, Means**: Willard's formula for transformation:
  - **Vision**: See what life in God's kingdom looks like. Catch a vision of becoming like Jesus.
  - **Intention**: Decide to pursue that life. Move from "That would be nice" to "I will."
  - **Means**: Adopt practices (spiritual disciplines) that make transformation possible.

Without all three, change doesn't happen. Vision without intention is fantasy. Intention without means is frustration. Means without vision is legalism.

**The Body as Training Ground**: Willard emphasized the body's role in spiritual formation. We are embodied beings, and our bodies either help or hinder spiritual growth. Disciplines like fasting, solitude, and Sabbath train the body to submit to the spirit. We can't become Christlike in our hearts while indulging every bodily appetite. The body must be taught to serve, not rule.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"Grace is not opposed to effort; it's opposed to earning."**
- **"You can live your life as if Jesus is not real, or you can live it as if He is the most real thing in the world."**
- **"The greatest tragedy of the human race is that we can live our whole lives and never really know God."**
- **"Ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life. Hurry is the great enemy of spiritual life in our world today."**
- **"Spiritual formation is the process by which the human spirit or will is given a definite form or character."**
- **"The aim of God in history is the creation of an all-inclusive community of loving persons with God himself at the very center of this community as its prime Sustainer and most glorious Inhabitant."**
- **"The disciple is one who, intent upon becoming Christ-like and so dwelling in His 'faith and practice,' systematically and progressively rearranges his affairs to that end."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Willard's philosophical training taught him precision of thought and clarity of expression. He didn't write devotional fluff; he wrote with rigor, defining terms, building arguments, and defending claims. Yet he wrote accessibly—academic depth made practical.

His dual vocation (philosopher and Christian teacher) positioned him uniquely. He could engage intellectual skeptics on their terms while also speaking to ordinary Christians seeking transformation. He built bridges between academy and church, showing that serious thought and deep devotion aren't enemies but allies.

Willard's humility and gentleness authenticated his message. He taught about transformation, and people saw transformation in him. He didn't promote himself, seek fame, or build an empire. He simply taught, wrote, and lived quietly in God's presence. Those who met him testified that he embodied what he taught—a rare congruence between message and messenger.

His later-life partnership with Richard Foster (they co-founded Renovaré's spiritual formation resources) combined Willard's philosophical depth with Foster's pastoral warmth. Together, they reshaped how evangelicals approach spiritual formation.

Willard's death in 2013 was met with widespread grief. But his books, teachings, and the movement he helped birth continue shaping Christians globally. His vision—that ordinary people can actually learn to live like Jesus—remains profoundly countercultural and profoundly hopeful.

## 12. A. W. TOZER (1897-1963)

### Biographical Context

Aiden Wilson Tozer was born in rural Pennsylvania, grew up in poverty, and had little formal education—he never attended seminary or college. At age seventeen, while working in a tire factory in Akron, Ohio, Tozer heard a street preacher and was converted. He immediately began devouring Christian books, teaching himself theology through intense reading.

Tozer was ordained in the Christian and Missionary Alliance denomination and pastored churches for 44 years—33 of those years at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago. He was known as a preacher's preacher, a prophet, and a mystic. His sermons were uncompromising, calling Christians to pursue God with whole-hearted passion rather than settling for nominal faith.

Tozer was old-fashioned in many ways—suspicious of entertainment-driven religion, opposed to church programs that substituted activity for intimacy with God, and critical of shallow evangelicalism. He preferred older Christian writers (Brother Lawrence, John of the Cross, Meister Eckhart) to contemporary ones. He believed the church had lost its way by focusing on techniques and growth strategies rather than knowing God.

He wrote prolifically—over 40 books, though most were compiled from sermons and editorials after his death. His two most famous works, "The Pursuit of God" and "The Knowledge of the Holy," are classics of Christian devotion, calling believers to rediscover the awe, wonder, and transforming presence of God.

Tozer died in 1963 at age 66. His legacy is a prophetic call to prioritize knowing God above all religious activity, and to cultivate a deep, worshipful awareness of God's presence.

### Major Works Overview

**"The Pursuit of God" (1948)** - Tozer's most beloved work, written as a passionate call to seek God Himself, not just His gifts. He argues that modern Christianity has become preoccupied with blessings, answers to prayer, doctrinal correctness, and religious activity—while neglecting the one thing that matters most: knowing and enjoying God.

The book is structured around attributes and experiences of God: His presence, His voice, His all-sufficiency, His indwelling. Each chapter builds toward a deeper encounter with the living God. Tozer writes with poetic intensity, blending Scripture, personal testimony, and prophetic urgency.

A famous line captures the book's spirit: "To have found God and still to pursue Him is the soul's paradox of love, scorned indeed by the too-easily-satisfied religionist, but justified in happy experience by the children of the burning heart."

**"The Knowledge of the Holy" (1961)** - A meditation on the attributes of God—His infinity, immutability, holiness, love, sovereignty, etc. Tozer argues that the most important thing about a person is what they think about God. Low thoughts of God lead to weak faith; exalted thoughts of God lead to transforming worship.

Each chapter explores one attribute, unpacking its meaning and implications. Tozer writes with awe and reverence, calling readers to worship as they learn. This isn't academic theology; it's doxology—theology that leads to praise.

**"The Divine Conquest" (1950)** - Explores the Christian's surrender to God. Tozer argues that God is pursuing us, seeking to conquer the rebel human heart. But we resist, clinging to autonomy, comfort, and self-will. True Christian life begins when we stop resisting and surrender fully to God's loving conquest.

**"Man: The Dwelling Place of God" (compiled sermons)** - A collection of Tozer's most powerful sermons on the indwelling Christ. He explores what it means for God to dwell in believers through the Holy Spirit, and how this transforms everything—our identity, our relationships, our purpose.

### Core Theological Positions

**Pursuit of God as Primary**: Tozer's central message is simple: God is to be pursued, known, and enjoyed for Himself, not for what He gives. Most Christians, Tozer argued, treat God as a means to an end—they want His blessings, His answers to prayer, His solutions to problems. But God isn't a cosmic vending machine. He's an infinitely glorious Being worthy of our whole-hearted pursuit.

This pursuit isn't about earning God's favor (salvation is by grace). It's about the Christian life post-conversion: will we settle for knowing about God, or will we press in to know Him? "We pursue God because, and only because, He has first put an urge within us that spurs us to the pursuit."

**God's Transcendence and Immanence**: Tozer held both truths: God is infinitely beyond us (transcendent—holy, other, incomprehensible) and yet nearer than breathing (immanent—present, accessible, indwelling). Many Christians emphasize one at the expense of the other. Tozer refused. God is both "high and lifted up" and "close to the brokenhearted."

**Critique of Shallow Christianity**: Tozer was unsparing in his critique of what he called "the new cross"—a comfortable, culturally accommodated Christianity that required no sacrifice, no surrender, no transformation. He wrote: "The old cross slew men; the new cross entertains them. The old cross condemned; the new cross amuses."

He believed the church had substituted activity for intimacy, programs for prayer, and entertainment for worship. While others celebrated church growth and evangelistic success, Tozer warned that numerical growth without spiritual depth was hollow.

**Worship as Ultimate Purpose**: For Tozer, humanity's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever (echoing the Westminster Catechism). Everything else—service, evangelism, moral living—flows from this. Worship isn't a part of Christian life; it's the heart of it. We were made to worship, and we're restless until we worship rightly.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us."**
- **"To have found God and still to pursue Him is the soul's paradox of love."**
- **"God is looking for people through whom He can do the impossible. What a pity we plan only the things we can do by ourselves."**
- **"The world is perishing for lack of the knowledge of God and the Church is famishing for want of His Presence."**
- **"We're here to be worshipers first and workers only second."**
- **"The man who comes to a right belief about God is relieved of ten thousand temporal problems."**
- **"A scared world needs a scarless church."**
- **"The old cross slew men; the new cross entertains them."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Tozer's lack of formal education made him a voracious self-taught reader. He read the Christian mystics, Puritan writers, and older devotional works that seminary graduates often hadn't encountered. This gave his writing depth and historical grounding that many contemporaries lacked.

His 33 years at one church (Southside Alliance in Chicago) kept him grounded in pastoral reality. He wasn't a celebrity pastor hopping from conference to conference. He faithfully shepherded one flock for decades, preaching the same message week after week: God is worthy of our whole-hearted pursuit.

Tozer's prophetic edge came at a cost. He wasn't universally loved. Some found him too intense, too critical, too old-fashioned. He had tensions in his denomination and wasn't afraid to speak uncomfortable truths. But this willingness to stand alone gave his words authority—he wasn't performing for applause; he was speaking what he believed God had shown him.

His personal life was reportedly ascetic—he spent hours in prayer, read constantly, and lived simply. Some biographers note that his intensity in pursuing God may have left his family feeling neglected (his wife Ada's posthumous comments suggested loneliness). This sobering reality reminds us that even prophets are flawed humans. Yet Tozer's message remains powerful: God is worth everything, and we must pursue Him with unrelenting passion.

## 13. BRENNAN MANNING (1934-2013)

### Biographical Context

Brennan Manning's life was a living testament to the scandalous grace he preached. Born Richard Francis Xavier Manning in Depression-era Brooklyn to working-class Irish Catholic parents, his early years were marked by insecurity, a stammer, and a deep sense of not measuring up.

At eighteen, he joined the U.S. Army and fought in the Korean War. During combat, pinned down by enemy fire, Manning made a desperate prayer: "God, if you get me out of here alive, I'll become a priest." He survived, and true to his word, entered seminary after discharge.

In 1956, Manning joined the Franciscan Friars, taking the name "Brennan." He was ordained in 1963 and spent years as a parish priest and later taught theology at St. Francis Seminary. But beneath the priestly exterior, Manning battled alcoholism—a struggle that would define much of his life.

In the 1970s, Manning experienced a profound spiritual awakening while on retreat. He encountered God's love in a way that shattered his performance-based religion. He realized he'd been trying to earn God's approval through ministry, good works, and religious discipline—while God loved him freely, not for what he did but for who he was.

Manning left institutional ministry and became a wandering speaker and writer, proclaiming the gospel of grace to anyone who would listen. He called himself a "ragamuffin"—Brennan's term for the broken, the failed, the struggling believers who know they're unworthy but cling to grace anyway.

But Manning's alcoholism continued to plague him. He had periods of sobriety and periods of relapse. His brokenness was public—he spoke openly about his failures, his addiction, his darkness. This radical honesty made him both beloved and controversial. Some questioned how a man battling addiction could teach about holiness. Manning's answer: "In Love's service, only wounded soldiers can serve."

He married Roslyn in 1982, bringing stability and support. But the demons remained. In his final years, his health deteriorated from alcoholism's effects. He died in 2013 at age 78, having spent his life proclaiming grace while embodying the need for it.

### Major Works Overview

**"The Ragamuffin Gospel" (1990)** - Manning's masterwork and the book that defines his legacy. The title comes from Jesus's words: "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Manning argues that the gospel is for ragamuffins—the bedraggled, beat-up, burnt-out, broken people who know they're unworthy.

The book contrasts "the impostor"—the false self we project to earn approval—with "the beloved"—our true identity as unconditionally loved by God. Manning writes with searing honesty about his own impostor: the "together" priest who secretly struggled with addiction and shame.

Core message: God's love isn't earned through performance, worthiness, or good behavior. It's freely given to the undeserving. Religion says "behave and you'll be accepted." Grace says "you're accepted, so you can become who God created you to be."

Famous line: "The gospel of grace nullifies our adulation of televangelists, charismatic superstars, and local church heroes. It obliterates the two-class citizenship theory operative in many American churches. For grace proclaims the awesome truth that all is gift. All that is good is ours not by right but by the sheer bounty of a gracious God."

**"Abba's Child" (1994)** - Explores our identity as God's beloved children. Manning argues that we spend life trying to be someone we're not—the impostor. But underneath the masks and performances is our true self: Abba's child, the beloved of God.

The book traces Manning's journey from striving to prove himself worthy (as priest, teacher, author) to resting in belovedness. He writes about his spiritual director's challenge: "Brennan, you don't need to do anything to make God love you more. And you can't do anything to make God love you less." This truth, simple yet revolutionary, became Manning's message.

**"The Furious Longing of God" (2009)** - Written late in life, this book explores God's passionate, relentless pursuit of us. Manning argues that we often think of spirituality as us seeking God. But the deeper truth is God seeking us—furiously, longingly, like a lover who won't give up.

He uses the parable of the prodigal son (which Manning calls "the parable of the compassionate father") to show God's reckless love. The father doesn't wait for the son to arrive home and apologize. He runs—undignified, shameless—to embrace the son while still far off. This is God's posture toward us: running, embracing, lavishing love on the undeserving.

**"Ruthless Trust" (2000)** - Manning's hardest book, written during a dark period of struggle. He explores trust in God when everything feels like it's falling apart—when prayers seem unanswered, when God feels absent, when you're battling your demons and losing.

"Ruthless trust" isn't naive optimism or pretending everything's fine. It's clinging to God's goodness even in darkness, even when feelings contradict faith. Manning writes from the depths, making this book raw and painful—and therefore deeply comforting to those in their own depths.

**"Souvenirs of Solitude" (1979)** - Manning's earliest work, written during a six-month hermitage in the Spanish wilderness. It's contemplative, mystical, exploring silence, solitude, and the prayer of listening. The book shows a different side of Manning—before the ragamuffin language, before the public struggles. Here he's a monk, seeking God in the wilderness.

### Core Theological Positions

**Grace for Ragamuffins**: Manning's central message is that grace isn't for the deserving; it's for the desperate. Jesus didn't come for the put-together, the successful, the righteous. He came for ragamuffins—the messy, the failing, the broken. And that's good news, because we're all ragamuffins underneath the masks.

This isn't permission to sin or stay stuck. But it is liberation from performance-based religion. You don't clean yourself up before coming to God. You come as you are, and God's grace cleans you up. As Manning wrote: "The gospel declares that no matter how dutiful or prayerful we are, we can't save ourselves. What Jesus did was sufficient."

**Belovedness as Primary Identity**: Drawing from Henri Nouwen (his close friend), Manning taught that our primary identity isn't sinner, failure, addict, success, or any role we play. It's "beloved of God." Before we do anything—good or bad—we ARE loved. This is our truest, deepest identity.

The impostor is the false self we construct to be acceptable. The beloved is who we actually are: Abba's children, unconditionally loved. Spiritual growth is shedding the impostor and living from belovedness.

**God's Furious Longing**: Manning flipped the script on spirituality. Instead of us desperately seeking an indifferent God, Manning proclaimed that God is desperately seeking us. God pursues with furious longing—running toward us, calling our name, refusing to give up even when we run away.

This changes everything. Spiritual life isn't about working hard to get God's attention. It's about waking up to the reality that God is already running toward you, arms open, love overflowing.

**Wounded Healers**: Manning lived Henri Nouwen's concept of "the wounded healer"—that our wounds, acknowledged honestly, become sources of healing for others. He didn't hide his alcoholism, his struggles, his failures. He spoke openly about his darkness, not to scandalize but to comfort other strugglers.

His message: you don't have to have it all together to minister to others. In fact, your wounds—when surrendered to God—become your most powerful tool. People don't need perfect guides; they need honest companions who know the terrain of brokenness and can point toward grace.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"The ragamuffin gospel says we can't lose God's love. Not by our worst sins, not by our best behavior. Grace is not a reward; it's a gift."**
- **"My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it."**
- **"The kingdom of heaven is not a prize to be won by good children. It is the property of the Father, and God gives it to whom He will."**
- **"Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is illusion."**
- **"In love's service, only wounded soldiers can serve."**
- **"Brennan, you don't need to do anything to make God love you more. And you can't do anything to make God love you less."** (His spiritual director's words that changed him)
- **"The Good News means we can stop lying to ourselves. The sweet sound of amazing grace saves us from the necessity of self-deception."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Manning's alcoholism and public struggles give his grace message devastating authenticity. He's not theorizing about grace from a distance. He's testifying as someone who needs it desperately, daily, hourly. When he says "I am a ragamuffin," it's not false humility—it's sober self-assessment.

His failures make him trustworthy. If he'd been a successful, together priest who never struggled, his message would ring hollow. But Manning was broken, and he didn't hide it. This honesty created permission for others to be honest. Thousands have said: "If God can love Brennan, maybe God can love me."

Manning's friendship with Henri Nouwen deeply shaped him. They were kindred spirits—both brilliant teachers who battled insecurity and need for approval. They encouraged each other, shared their struggles, and pointed each other back to belovedness. Their friendship modeled grace in action.

The controversy around Manning—some questioning whether a relapsing alcoholic should be teaching—raises important questions. But Manning never claimed to be a model of sanctification. He claimed to be a model of neediness for grace. His message wasn't "Look at me; I've got it all together." It was "Look at Jesus; He loves ragamuffins like me."

Manning's death in 2013 was met with both grief and gratitude. He'd been broken until the end—alcoholism ravaged his health, and he battled demons to his last days. But his message outlives him: the ragamuffin gospel, the good news that grace is for the undeserving, that belovedness is our truest identity, and that God's love cannot be earned or lost.

## 14. RICHARD ROHR (1943– )

### Biographical Context

Richard Rohr is a Franciscan friar, priest, and teacher whose work bridges contemplative spirituality, social justice, and a non-dualistic way of seeing God and the world. Born in Kansas to German Catholic parents, Rohr joined the Franciscans in 1961 at age eighteen, drawn to Francis of Assisi's radical commitment to simplicity, peace, and solidarity with the poor.

Rohr was ordained in 1970 and spent the 1970s and 80s as a charismatic preacher, drawing large crowds with his passionate teaching. But over time, his theology deepened and shifted. He moved beyond conservative evangelical categories, incorporating insights from mysticism, Jungian psychology, the Enneagram, liberation theology, and contemplative practice.

In 1987, Rohr founded the Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The name reflects his core conviction: action (working for justice, serving the poor) and contemplation (prayer, silence, inner work) must be held together. Activists without contemplation burn out or become angry. Contemplatives without action become escapist. The integration of both is the Franciscan way.

Rohr's teaching is both deeply traditional (rooted in Scripture, Franciscan spirituality, and Christian mystics) and surprisingly progressive (affirming LGBTQ+ individuals, critiquing empire and militarism, embracing interfaith dialogue). This makes him controversial in conservative circles but beloved by many seeking a spirituality beyond culture war binaries.

Now in his eighties, Rohr continues writing, teaching through CAC's Daily Meditations, and mentoring a new generation of contemplative activists.

### Major Works Overview

**"Falling Upward: A Spirituality for the Two Halves of Life" (2011)** - Rohr's most accessible and popular book. He argues that life naturally divides into two halves:

- **First half**: Building the container—establishing identity, career, family, beliefs. This is necessary but incomplete. First-half spirituality tends to be dualistic (right/wrong, us/them, sacred/secular), focused on success, achievement, and certainty.

- **Second half**: Filling the container—deepening, questioning, integrating shadow, embracing mystery. Second-half spirituality is non-dualistic, contemplative, and focused on being rather than doing. But you can't skip the first half. You have to build something before you can transcend it.

The title "falling upward" captures the paradox: we often enter the second half through failure, loss, or suffering—what Rohr calls "necessary suffering." We fall (lose the first-half securities), and somehow this falling becomes rising into deeper truth.

**"The Universal Christ" (2019)** - Rohr distinguishes between Jesus (the historical person) and Christ (the eternal presence of God manifest throughout creation from the beginning). Christ is larger than Jesus—Christ is the Logos, the pattern that connects all things, the cosmic Christ described in Colossians 1 and John 1.

This doesn't diminish Jesus; it expands our understanding of Christ. Jesus is the human incarnation of the eternal Christ. And if Christ is universal (present in all creation), then we can encounter Christ in nature, in other people, in beauty, in suffering—not just in church or Bible or sacrament.

Conservative critics charge that this universalism undermines Jesus's uniqueness. Rohr responds: Jesus is unique as the full revelation, but Christ's presence isn't limited to those who name Jesus. God is bigger than our boxes.

**"Everything Belongs: The Gift of Contemplative Prayer" (2003)** - Explores non-dualistic consciousness and contemplative prayer. Rohr argues that Western Christianity has been overly dualistic—dividing reality into good/evil, sacred/secular, us/them. This creates violence, judgment, and fear.

Contemplative prayer trains us to see non-dualistically—to hold tensions, embrace paradox, and recognize that "everything belongs" (even suffering, failure, and shadow). This doesn't mean everything is good, but that God can use everything for transformation.

**"Immortal Diamond: The Search for Our True Self" (2013)** - Rohr's version of Nouwen's belovedness and Manning's beloved. He distinguishes the "false self" (ego, constructed identity, masks) from the "true self" (our deepest identity in God, the "immortal diamond" that can't be destroyed).

The spiritual journey is shedding the false self to discover the true self. This happens through suffering, contemplation, and grace. The true self was always there—we don't create it; we uncover it.

**"Breathing Under Water: Spirituality and the Twelve Steps" (2011)** - Rohr applies the wisdom of Alcoholics Anonymous's 12 Steps to all of Christian life. He argues that the steps aren't just for addicts; they're a spiritual path for anyone who recognizes their powerlessness and need for grace.

Rohr sees the 12 Steps as profoundly Christian (though AA is non-denominational). They require admitting powerlessness, surrendering to a Higher Power, moral inventory, confession, amends, prayer, and helping others. This mirrors the gospel journey: recognizing need, surrendering to God, transformation, and service.

### Core Theological Positions

**Non-Dualistic Consciousness**: Rohr's central contribution is teaching non-dualistic ways of seeing. Dualistic thinking divides reality into either/or categories: good or evil, right or wrong, saved or damned, sacred or secular. This creates judgment, violence, and fear.

Non-dualistic thinking holds both/and: paradox, mystery, tensions. It's not moral relativism (Rohr affirms truth and goodness). It's recognizing that reality is more complex than our categories. Jesus taught non-dualistically: "Judge not." "Love your enemies." "The last shall be first." These transcend dualistic logic.

**Falling Upward / Necessary Suffering**: Rohr argues that growth often requires descending before ascending. We have to fail, lose, or suffer before we can truly mature. He calls this "necessary suffering"—not suffering we seek, but suffering we accept and let transform us.

The first half of life avoids suffering, seeking success and security. The second half accepts suffering as teacher. The cross is the ultimate symbol: Jesus descends into death before rising. We follow the same pattern.

**The Universal Christ**: Rohr's most controversial teaching. He argues that Christ (the eternal Word, Logos) is present throughout creation from the beginning. Jesus is the historical incarnation of this universal Christ, but Christ's presence isn't limited to post-incarnation history.

This means God's presence can be encountered anywhere—in nature, beauty, other religions, suffering. Christianity's uniqueness isn't that we have Christ and others don't. It's that in Jesus, we see Christ most clearly.

**True Self vs. False Self**: Rohr uses Jungian language to describe the spiritual journey. The false self is the ego—our constructed identity based on roles, achievements, and others' opinions. It's not evil, but it's limited and fragile.

The true self is our deepest identity—the imago Dei, our belovedness, the "immortal diamond." Discovering the true self requires letting go of the false self. This is scary because we've invested our whole lives building the false self. But it's liberating because the true self can't be destroyed or lost.

### Signature Phrases & Concepts

- **"We don't think ourselves into new ways of living; we live ourselves into new ways of thinking."**
- **"The best criticism of the bad is the practice of the better."**
- **"If God is Trinity, then relationship is the very shape of reality."**
- **"Pain that is not transformed is transmitted."**
- **"We are all beginners at every moment. We never arrive; we just keep starting over."**
- **"The path to resurrection always includes a descent into the tomb."**
- **"Your False Self is who you think you are. Your True Self is who you really are: an eternal, indestructible, immortal diamond."**

### Life Story Informs Writing

Rohr's Franciscan vocation grounds everything he teaches. Francis of Assisi modeled radical simplicity, love of creation, solidarity with the poor, and non-violence. Rohr has spent sixty+ years living this tradition, and it shows in his emphasis on action and contemplation, justice and prayer, caring for the marginalized and encountering God in all creation.

His early years as a charismatic preacher gave him public speaking skills and ability to communicate complex ideas accessibly. But his later shift toward contemplation and depth prevents superficiality. He's not just a motivational speaker; he's a mystic who's spent decades in silence, solitude, and prayer.

Rohr's social justice commitments (he's been arrested for protesting nuclear weapons, advocated for the poor, and affirmed LGBTQ+ individuals) flow from his contemplation. He doesn't separate spirituality from politics. For Rohr, contemplation that doesn't lead to compassion and justice isn't true contemplation.

His willingness to challenge conservative orthodoxies (on hell, salvation, LGBTQ+ issues, interfaith dialogue) has made him controversial. Some evangelicals dismiss him as heretical. But many find in Rohr permission to ask questions they'd been afraid to ask and explore depths of faith they didn't know existed.

Rohr's age (now in his eighties) gives him gravitas. He's not a young rebel; he's an elder who's walked the path, faced the questions, and emerged with a deep, expansive faith. He embodies the "second half of life" spirituality he teaches.
