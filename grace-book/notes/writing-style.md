## Writing Style & Tone Guidelines

### Voice:
- **First-person, confessional:** "I" language, not "you should" language. The author is a fellow wayfarer, not an expert lecturing from a podium.
- **Conversational, not academic:** Reads like a letter from a friend, a late-night conversation over coffee, a shared confession between pilgrims.
- **Poetic and vivid:** Uses metaphor, imagery, sensory detail. Every abstract concept needs a concrete image.
- **Honest, even raw:** Doesn't sanitize the struggle. Shows the mud, the tears, the anger, the doubt.
- **Hope-filled, not preachy:** Points to grace without demanding. Invites without coercing. Testifies without prescribing.
- **Musical:** Even the prose has rhythm. Sentences flow. Paragraphs breathe. White space matters.

### Structure:
- **Short paragraphs:** Easy to read, breaths between thoughts. Dense paragraphs feel like swamps.
- **Story-driven:** Each chapter opens with story/scene, not doctrine. Theology emerges from narrative.
- **Lyrical prose:** Rhythm and flow matter. Read sentences aloud to test them.
- **Space on the page:** Use white space. Line breaks. Pauses. Let the reader breathe.
- **Varied pacing:** Some sections are urgent (Chapter 5). Some are meditative (Chapter 7). Some are celebratory (Chapter 8). Match pace to content.

### Scripture Use:
- **Integrated, not proof-texted:** Scripture emerges from the story organically. Not: "Here's a verse to support my point." But: "Here's a story, and Scripture tells it like this..."
- **Multiple translations:** Use whichever translation best captures the moment (ESV, NIV, MSG, NRSV, etc.)
- **Expansive, not restrictive:** Scripture opens doors, doesn't close them. Invites deeper, doesn't limit.
- **Narrative over proposition:** Tell the Bible's stories, don't just cite verses. Let the story carry the theology.

### Imagery Bank:

Key metaphors to develop throughout:
- **Swamp:** Stuck, muck, drowning, stench, darkness, exhaustion
- **Water's Edge:** Liminal space, transition, vulnerability, cleansing, encounter
- **Water:** Living, flowing, cleansing, life-giving, baptismal, deep
- **Rhythms:** Dance, breath, tide, heartbeat, seasons, music
- **Journey:** Wayfarer, pilgrim, road, footprints, horizon, trail
- **Light/Shadow:** Protection, evidence of light, shelter, covering
- **Growth:** Roots, seeds, trees, fruit, soil, harvest
- **Music:** Melody, harmony, dissonance, resolution, rhythm, rest
