# **The Holy Spirit – Our Helper Today**

**Three R's Devotional Framework**

I've struggled for many years about prayer.  You know, the classic response is God says Yes, No, Maybe.  That can't be all there is to it, can it?  I wanted a framework that allowed God to always, and mean 100%, provide a response that was a "Yes".  Not that He would always give me what I want, but what I need.  So I created a framework I call "The Three R's": My Reality, My Response, God's Results.  It goes like this...

## **Reality – What Is Happening in My Life**

Even when life feels heavy, the Holy Spirit is **present and active**.

* **Indwelling** – *"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"* (1 Corinthians 3:16)
* **Guiding** – *"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth."* (John 16:13)
* **Empowering** – *"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."* (Acts 1:8)
* **Comforting** – *"I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever."* (John 14:16)

**Prompt:**

> What's my honest situation right now? Where do I see the Spirit's fingerprints in it, even if the picture isn't clear yet?

## **Response – How I Will Choose to Act**

The Spirit's help is an **invitation to partnership**, not passivity.

* **Surrender** – *"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."* (Galatians 5:16)
* **Prayerful Listening** – *"My sheep hear my voice… and they follow me."* (John 10:27)
* **Small-Step Obedience** – *"Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit."* (Galatians 5:25)
* **Hope Over Despair** – *"…by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."* (Romans 15:13)

**Prompt:**

> What step of faith, however small, will I take today in cooperation with the Spirit?

## **Results – What God Will Produce**

The Spirit works for God's glory and our transformation.

* **Character Growth** – *"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace…"* (Galatians 5:22–23)
* **Peace Beyond Circumstances** – *"The mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace."* (Romans 8:6)
* **Guidance** – *"He will make straight your paths."* (Proverbs 3:6)
* **Power to Witness** – *"You will be my witnesses…"* (Acts 1:8)

**Prompt:**

> How has my heart, attitude, or focus shifted? Where can I already see God's fingerprints in this situation?

**Closing Prayer:**

> Holy Spirit, thank You for being my Helper today. In my reality, guide my response so that Your results bring glory to God. Amen.
