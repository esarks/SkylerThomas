### Chapter 4: Dying Changes Everything
**Based on:** "Dying Changes Everything"

**Opening Scene:**

Someone once said: "Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes everything."

It's true. You can come close to the edge, peek over, and walk back unchanged. You can almost hit bottom and still cling to the old life. Almost-dying gives you a scare, maybe even a wake-up call. But it doesn't transform you.

Dying does.

And I'm not talking about biological death (though we'll get there). I'm talking about the spiritual deaths we all must undergo if we're going to truly live.

There's a moment in every spiritual journey when you realize: something has to die.

Maybe it's a relationship that's turned toxic. Maybe it's a dream that's become an idol. Maybe it's the version of yourself you've been clinging to—the capable one, the strong one, the one who has it all together.

Maybe it's your understanding of God—the tame, predictable, manageable God you created to feel safe.

Something has to die. And you know it. But knowing it and accepting it are very different things.

Paint a specific scene: You're in a counseling session, finally admitting out loud that the ministry you've poured your life into is killing you. Or you're on your knees in the bathroom, sobbing, because the marriage you thought would save you is ending. Or you're staring at an email that changes everything—the job loss, the diagnosis, the betrayal.

Death feels like defeat. Like failure. Like the end.

But what if death is actually the beginning?

**The Opening Statement:**

"I died twice—once to my old self, once to my illusions about God. Both deaths were grace."

This chapter is about death as transformation. Not just biological death (though we'll talk about eternal perspective), but the spiritual deaths we all must undergo if we're going to truly live.

Paul said it: "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).

Before resurrection, there must be a tomb.

**Key Themes:**

**1. Death as Transformation**

Death in Scripture is rarely just about biological cessation. It's about transformation, passage, transition.

Explore different kinds of death:
- Death to the false self
- Death to illusions
- Death to control
- Death to the life you planned so you can live the life God has for you

The death of my music career felt like the death of myself. I'd poured everything into it—my identity, my worth, my purpose. When it crumbled, I didn't know who I was.

I remember the night I finally admitted it was over. I was alone in my studio, looking at equipment I couldn't afford and songs that nobody wanted. I sat at the piano and couldn't play. Literally couldn't. My hands just sat on the keys.

And I whispered to God, "If this is dying, I hate it."

But here's what I didn't understand then: God wasn't killing my music. He was killing my addiction to success. He was killing the idol I'd made of my gift. He was killing the version of me that needed applause to feel alive.

The music had to die so the musician could live.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer understood this death with startling clarity. From his prison cell, facing execution, he wrote what would become his most famous line:

> "When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die."

— Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*

Bonhoeffer wasn't being dramatic. He was being literal. Within weeks of writing those words, he would be executed by the Nazis for his resistance to Hitler. But the death he spoke of wasn't primarily physical—it was the death of self-will, the death of self-preservation, the death of the life we think we want so we can receive the life God offers.

Bonhoeffer distinguished between "cheap grace" and "costly grace." Cheap grace is forgiveness without transformation, salvation without discipleship, acceptance without surrender. It's grace that costs us nothing because it demands nothing. Costly grace, on the other hand, "is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life."

The swamp offers cheap grace: stay as you are, just feel better about it. True grace—costly grace—demands death. Not as punishment, but as passage. The old must die so the new can live.

**2. The Death of the False Self**

The false self is the person you've been pretending to be. The mask you wear. The performance you give. The image you maintain.

Dallas Willard called this "the gospel of sin management"—reducing Christianity to forgiveness without transformation. We want to be saved from sin's consequences without dying to sin's power in our lives.

The false self is built on:
- What people expect
- What earns approval
- What feels safe
- What maintains control

The false self says:
- "If people knew the real me, they'd reject me"
- "I have to perform to be loved"
- "Vulnerability is weakness"
- "I am what I accomplish"

Dallas Willard, with characteristic clarity, identifies the core problem:

> "Grace is not opposed to effort; it's opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is an action."

— Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*

The false self is built on earning—trying to deserve love, approval, acceptance through performance. Willard's insight cuts through this: grace is free, but it requires effort to receive. Not the effort of earning, but the effort of surrender. The effort of letting the false self die.

Willard taught that transformation happens through what he called "VIM": Vision, Intention, and Means. You need a vision of who God is calling you to become (your true self). You need the intention to pursue that transformation. And you need means—spiritual disciplines that position you to receive God's transforming grace.

But all three require death. Vision requires dying to your current self-image. Intention requires dying to comfort and control. Means require dying to the habits and patterns that keep you stuck.

Create a chart:

| **The False Self** | **The True Self** |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Performs for approval | Rests in acceptance |
| Fears exposure | Practices honesty |
| Needs to be right | Can admit wrong |
| Hides weakness | Confesses need |
| Image-management | Authenticity |
| Exhausting | Life-giving |

**3. Dying to Control, Certainty, Performance**

Control is one of the hardest things to surrender. We want to manage outcomes, predict futures, protect ourselves from pain.

Certainty is another. We want answers, not mysteries. Doctrine, not doubt. Clear lines, not gray areas.

Performance is the way we try to earn what grace offers freely.

All three have to die.

**Dying to Control:**
Tell a story of when you had to surrender control. A health crisis where you couldn't fix yourself. A relationship where you couldn't change the other person. A circumstance where all your efforts failed.

The death of control feels like freefall. But actually, it's falling into the arms of the One who's been holding you all along.

**Dying to Certainty:**
This is hard for many Christians because we've been taught that doubt is the opposite of faith. But actually, certainty is the opposite of faith. Faith requires trust in the midst of mystery.

Tell a story of theological deconstruction. The questions you asked. The doubts you had. The beliefs you reconsidered. And how terrifying it was to admit, "I don't know."

But also how that honesty—that death of false certainty—opened space for a bigger, truer God.

**Dying to Performance:**
You can't earn grace. You can't perform your way to God's love. Every spiritual discipline done to prove yourself is just another attempt at self-salvation.

The death of performance means you stop. You rest. You receive. You let yourself be loved not because you're impressive, but because you're beloved.

Brennan Manning lived this truth in the most public, painful way possible. A Franciscan priest and sought-after speaker, Manning battled alcoholism his entire adult life. He relapsed publicly, struggled visibly, and never achieved the victory narrative we expect from Christian leaders.

Yet from that place of acknowledged brokenness, he wrote some of the most grace-saturated words in modern Christian literature:

> "My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it."

— Brennan Manning, *The Ragamuffin Gospel*

Manning called himself a "ragamuffin"—bedraggled, beat-up, burnt-out, but beloved. He knew he couldn't perform his way to God's approval. His addiction wouldn't let him maintain the illusion of having it together. So performance had to die.

What emerged was radical honesty: "Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true self. Every other identity is illusion."

Manning's message scandalizes religious performance. If a relapsing alcoholic can be beloved of God—not after he gets better, but right now, in the middle of his struggle—then none of us can earn God's love. Performance has to die because it was never the path to God anyway.

**4. Why Resurrection Requires a Tomb**

You can't be raised unless you've died. You can't experience resurrection unless you've been in the tomb.

Jesus spent Saturday in the grave. Between the death on Friday and the resurrection on Sunday, there was a tomb. Dark. Silent. Seemingly final.

Most of us live on Saturday. We've experienced death—of dreams, relationships, certainties, selves—and we're waiting in the tomb. We know about Easter Sunday theologically, but we're living in Saturday emotionally.

This section affirms: The tomb is part of the journey. Saturday is necessary. You can't skip from Friday to Sunday.

But Saturday doesn't last forever. Resurrection is coming.

**Biblical Parallels:**

**Jesus in Gethsemane (Luke 22:39-46):**

Jesus knows He's going to die. He's sweating blood, begging the Father, "If you are willing, take this cup from me."

This is crucial: Jesus didn't want to die. He didn't spiritualize it. He didn't pretend it was easy. He asked for another way.

But then: "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

That's the death that changes everything. The death of His will, His preference, His desire to avoid pain. Surrendered to the Father's will.

And because Jesus died that death in the garden before He died the death on the cross, resurrection was possible.

Explore what it means for us: What needs to die in us? What cup are we begging God to take away? And what would it mean to pray, "Not my will, but Yours"?

**Paul's Testimony (1 Corinthians 15:31, Galatians 2:20, Philippians 3:7-11):**

Paul talks about dying constantly.

"I die daily" (1 Corinthians 15:31) - Every day, a death to self. Every day, a surrender.

"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me" (Galatians 2:20) - The old Paul is dead. Saul, the persecutor, is gone. A new creation lives.

"I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ" (Philippians 3:7-8).

Paul had to die to:
- His reputation (from respected Pharisee to rejected apostle)
- His certainties (all his theological training had to be reconsidered)
- His control (shipwrecked, beaten, imprisoned)
- His plans (wanted to go to Spain, ended up in Rome—in chains)

But every death brought resurrection. Every loss brought gain. Every tomb preceded new life.

**The Grain of Wheat (John 12:24):**

"Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."

Jesus says this right before His own death. He's explaining the principle: Death is how life multiplies.

A seed that stays a seed stays alone. Safe. Intact. Unchanging. But also unfruitful.

A seed that falls, that dies, that's buried in the dark soil—that seed becomes a plant. Then a stalk. Then a head of grain. Then many seeds.

One death. Much fruit.

What's the seed in your life that needs to fall and die? What are you clutching that needs to be buried so it can multiply?

**Theological Anchor:**

**Galatians 2:20** - "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."

Unpack every phrase:
- **"I have been crucified with Christ"** - Past tense. It's already happened. When Christ died, you died. The old self, the false self, the self that's separated from God—dead.
- **"I no longer live"** - The old you is gone. This isn't self-improvement. This is death and resurrection.
- **"But Christ lives in me"** - The resurrection. New life. Not self-generated. Christ-generated.
- **"The life I now live in the body"** - Still human. Still here. Still embodied. But transformed.
- **"I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me"** - The foundation. Not your performance. His love. His sacrifice.

Connect this to baptism: In Romans 6:3-4, Paul says we're baptized into Christ's death so we can be raised to new life. Baptism is a death ritual. You go under the water (death, burial), you come up out of the water (resurrection).

Every Christian has already died. Already been buried. Already been raised. Now we're living into that reality.

**The Illusion of Spiritual Resuscitation:**

Picture the scene: A person lies motionless on the hospital table. The room erupts in controlled chaos. "Code blue!" Someone yells for the crash cart. Nurses rush in. The defibrillator charges—that rising whine of power building. The doctor grabs the paddles. "Clear!"

BANG!

The body jerks violently, arching off the table. Chest heaving. Head thrown back. Everyone holds their breath, eyes fixed on the monitor.

And then—beep... beep... beep.

The heart is beating again. Life restored. A successful resuscitation.

This is physical restoration. Medical intervention bringing someone back from the edge of death. And we celebrate it—rightly so.

But here's the problem: Too many of us approach our spiritual life the same way. We keep trying to resuscitate the old self. We put our fleshly nature on the table—the performance-driven, approval-seeking, control-grasping version of ourselves—and we call in the spiritual crash cart.

We try spiritual disciplines (CLEAR! BANG!). We try renewed commitment (CLEAR! BANG!). We try accountability groups, Bible studies, worship conferences, self-help books (CLEAR! BANG! BANG! BANG!).

And we pray desperately: "God, bring this back to life! Make the old me work! Fix what's broken in this version of myself!"

But that's not what Jesus wants.

Paul makes this startlingly clear in Romans 6:5-7:

> "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—because anyone who has died has been set free from sin."

Notice: "Our old self was crucified." Not resuscitated. Not revived. Not repaired. **Crucified.**

And verse 11 continues: "Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus."

Count yourselves **dead**. Not recovering. Not in critical condition. Not needing spiritual CPR. Dead.

The old self—the one driven by sin, by ego, by performance, by the need to prove and earn and control—that self cannot be resuscitated. It must die completely. Because resurrection isn't bringing the old life back. It's receiving an entirely new life.

Jesus doesn't want your old self on life support. He doesn't want you managing and maintaining a dying version of yourself. He wants complete death that leads to complete life.

This is Romans 6:4 in practice: "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

Not the same life, resuscitated. A **new** life. A different life. A life you didn't have before.

The crash cart keeps the old alive. The cross kills the old so the new can emerge. They're opposite approaches.

Stop trying to revive what God is trying to bury. Let it die. The beeping monitor of your old self—flatline it. Because only when that line goes flat can resurrection begin.

**The Wayfarer Moment:**

**You can't be resurrected until you're willing to die. Grace requires surrender of the self we've been protecting.**

This is the scariest wayfarer moment yet. Because death feels like loss. Like failure. Like the end.

But the wayfarer learns: Death is passage. The tomb is not the end; it's the womb. What feels like dying is actually being born.

Tell your story: What died in you that needed to die? How did you resist? How did you finally surrender? What resurrection came on the other side?

I didn't want the old me to die. I liked him. He was successful. Respected. Put-together. Sure, he was exhausted and empty inside, but at least he looked good.

When God started dismantling that version of me—taking away the platforms, the approval, the certainties—I fought. Hard. I was furious. I felt abandoned.

But slowly, painfully, I started to see: God wasn't destroying me. He was liberating me. The old me was a prison. And He loved me too much to leave me there.

Bonhoeffer faced literal death with this understanding. The night before his execution, he reportedly told a fellow prisoner: "This is the end—for me, the beginning of life." He understood what we're all called to understand: death is passage, not termination. The tomb is temporary. Resurrection is certain.

**Song Integration:**

**Song: "Dying Changes Everything"**

**Verse 1**
I'm sinking deep, the waters rising
Lost inside this broken place
Breathing in the weight of silence
Drowning in my own disgrace
My eyes grow dim, my strength is failing
Shadows closing all around
But in the stillness I hear You whisper
"Child, you will be found"

**Pre-Chorus**
Tick tock… time fades out
Your voice breaks through the doubt

**Chorus**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I release the chains I'm clutching
Now I rise on eagle's wings
Spirit lifts me from the waters
Breath of heaven fills my lungs
In surrender I discover
New life rising with the Son

**Verse 2**
The veil is torn, the light is breaking
Your time has forever come
Flames of mercy burn around me
Pulling me to Kingdom's throne
Grace like lightning strikes my spirit
Love restores my heart again
No more running, no more hiding
I am free in Jesus' name

**Pre-Chorus**
Tick tock… time fades out
Your voice breaks through the doubt

**Chorus (Big)**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I release the chains I'm clutching
Now I rise on eagle's wings
Spirit lifts me from the waters
Breath of heaven fills my lungs
In surrender I discover
New life rising with the Son

**Bridge (Build)**
I have crossed from death to life
You're the fire, You're the light
Nothing stands but Jesus Christ
Dying changes everything
(Repeat as needed, rising each time)

**Verse 3**
Now I stand, my chains are broken
Every shadow swept away
Hope is rising, faith has spoken
Night has turned to brighter day
I will sing of resurrection
Testify to what You've done
From the grave into Your glory
All my battles now are won

**Final Chorus / Tag**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I am living in Your presence
Breathing heaven's holy breath

**Outro (Soft, reflective)**
THUMP… thump… (heartbeat slows)
Tick… tock… time is gone
Eternal life has just begun
Jesus, You're my only song
Dying changed it all

**The Story Behind the Song:**

I wrote this song in the tomb. Between the death and the resurrection. On a Saturday.

Everything I'd built my life on had crumbled. My marriage was hanging by a thread. My ministry had imploded. My faith was in question. I didn't know who I was anymore.

I sat with my guitar, and this song poured out. Not a triumphant resurrection song. A Saturday song. A tomb song. A "I'm dying and I don't know if I'll ever live again" song.

The opening lines came from a real moment—sinking deep, waters rising, drowning in my own disgrace. I was living in Psalm 69: "Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold."

But even in that sinking, I heard the whisper: "Child, you will be found." Not "get yourself together and then I'll find you." But "you will be found"—right here, right now, in the drowning.

The chorus became my theology: "Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes everything." I'd been almost-dying for years—coming close to the edge, getting scared, pulling back, staying stuck. But real death—the death of the false self, the death of control, the death of the illusions I'd built my life on—that was different.

Dying meant releasing the chains I was clutching. Those chains felt like security, but they were actually bondage. Letting go felt terrifying. But it was the only way to rise.

The bridge came later, after some resurrection had begun: "I have crossed from death to life / You're the fire, You're the light / Nothing stands but Jesus Christ." Everything else had died. And what remained was Him. Just Him. And that was enough.

Here's what I didn't know then: Writing that song WAS the resurrection beginning. Admitting the death. Naming the loss. Trusting that somehow, in ways I couldn't see, God was making all things new.

Dying does change everything. Because it's the only way to truly live.

**Reflections for the Road:**

- What in you needs to die? What are you clinging to that God might be asking you to release?
- What's your Saturday? Where are you stuck between death and resurrection?
- Read Romans 6:1-14. What does it mean that you've already died with Christ?
- What would resurrection look like for you? Not going back to the old life, but being raised to a new one?

**Practice: The Burial Prayer**

Find a quiet place. Bring something that represents what needs to die—an old journal, a symbol of a role you've outgrown, a picture of a dream you're surrendering.

Hold it. Acknowledge it. Thank God for it, even.

Then, pray a burial prayer:
"God, I surrender this. I let it die. I trust You to resurrect what's meant to live and to bury what's meant to stay dead. Amen."

If possible, literally bury the object or put it away somewhere you won't see it. A physical act of release.

**Closing Image:**

The tomb. Silent. Dark. Waiting. Saturday—between death and resurrection. The most honest place to be.

You're in the tomb. But you're not alone. And Sunday's coming.
