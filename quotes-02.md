# Author Quotes for Chapter 2: Too Much of a Good Thing

## Theme: Abundance, Greed, Consumerism, Idolatry of Good Things

---

## 1. G.K. Chesterton on Gratitude and Possession

> "The test of all happiness is gratitude; and I felt grateful, though I hardly knew to whom. Children are grateful when Santa Claus puts in their stockings gifts of toys or sweets. Could I not be grateful to Santa Claus when he put in my stockings the gift of two miraculous legs? We thank people for birthday presents of cigars and slippers. Can I thank no one for the birthday present of birth?"
>
> — G.K. Chesterton, *Orthodoxy*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Chesterton captures the shift from possession to gratitude. The chapter explores how we clutch gifts instead of receiving them with thanksgiving. When we see everything as gift (even our very existence), we hold loosely. When we see things as possessions we've earned or deserve, we grasp tightly.

## 2. John Calvin on the Human Heart as Idol Factory

> "The human heart is a factory of idols... Everyone of us is, from his mother's womb, expert in inventing idols."
>
> — John Calvin, *Institutes of the Christian Religion*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** This quote names the core problem: we don't just make idols out of bad things; we make idols out of *everything*. Good gifts become gods. The chapter's key insight is that even ministry, music, success, and relationships can become idols when we use them to fill the God-shaped void.

## 3. Timothy Keller on Counterfeit Gods

> "What is an idol? It is anything more important to you than God, anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God, anything you seek to give you what only God can give. An idol is whatever you look at and say, in your heart of hearts, 'If I have that, then I'll feel my life has meaning, then I'll know I have value, then I'll feel significant and secure.'"
>
> — Timothy Keller, *Counterfeit Gods*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Keller defines idolatry perfectly for this chapter's theme. The rich young ruler had wealth as his idol. We might have success, approval, platform, or even spiritual experiences as ours. This quote helps readers identify their own "too much of a good thing."

## 4. Thomas Merton on False Self and True Self

> "Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self. We are not very good at recognizing illusions, least of all the ones we cherish about ourselves. All sin starts from the assumption that my false self, the self that exists only in my own egocentric desires, is the fundamental reality of life to which everything else in the universe is ordered."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Merton exposes how we build identity on the false self—the self defined by accomplishments, possessions, reputation. Chapter 2 explores the exhaustion of maintaining that false self through accumulation. True freedom comes when the false self dies and the beloved self emerges.

## 5. A.W. Tozer on Possessing vs. Being Possessed

> "There is within the human heart a tough fibrous root of fallen life whose nature is to possess, always to possess. It covets 'things' with a deep and fierce passion. The pronouns 'my' and 'mine' look innocent enough in print, but their constant and universal use is significant. They express the real nature of the old Adamic man better than a thousand volumes of theology could do. They are verbal symptoms of our deep disease. The roots of our hearts have grown down into things, and we dare not pull up one rootlet lest we die. Things have become necessary to us, a development never originally intended. God's gifts now take the place of God, and the whole course of nature is upset by the monstrous substitution."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Pursuit of God*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Tozer masterfully describes the psychology of possession—how our hearts grow roots into things until we can't imagine life without them. This is exactly what Chapter 2 addresses: the monstrous substitution of God's gifts for God Himself.

## 6. Simone Weil on Detachment

> "Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone who is detached."
>
> — Simone Weil, *Gravity and Grace*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Weil's concept of detachment isn't about not caring; it's about not grasping. The chapter's contrast between holding with open hands (gift) vs. clutching with white knuckles (possession) is exactly what Weil means by detachment. Only when we stop clutching can we see reality clearly.

## 7. Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Cheap Grace

> "Cheap grace is the grace we bestow on ourselves. Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession... Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."
>
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** While Bonhoeffer is talking about grace, this applies to Chapter 2's theme of wanting God's gifts without God Himself. We want blessing without surrender, abundance without trust, spiritual experiences without transformation. The rich young ruler wanted eternal life without letting go of his wealth—cheap eternal life.

## 8. Annie Dillard on Abundance and Waste

> "The creator loves pizzazz... Nature is, above all, profligate. Don't believe them when they tell you how economical and thrifty nature is, whose leaves return to the soil. Wouldn't it be cheaper to leave them on the tree in the first place? This deciduous business alone is a radical scheme, the brainchild of a deranged manic-depressive with limitless capital."
>
> — Annie Dillard, *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Dillard captures God's extravagant generosity in creation. The chapter needs to distinguish between God's abundance (which is gift, overflow, generosity) and our greed (which is grasping, hoarding, fear). God isn't stingy—He's wildly generous. But we turn gift into possession.

## 9. Blaise Pascal on the God-Shaped Vacuum

> "What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself."
>
> — Blaise Pascal, *Pensées*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Pascal's "God-shaped vacuum" is foundational to understanding why "more" never satisfies. We try to fill the infinite hole with finite things—possessions, success, relationships, experiences. The chapter explores this futility and points to the only thing that actually fills: God Himself.

---

## 10. Francis Chan on Lukewarm Faith

> "The irony is that while God doesn't need us but still wants us, we desperately need God but don't really want Him most of the time. He treasures us and anticipates our departure from this earth to be with Him—and we wonder, indifferently, how much we have to do for Him to get by."
>
> — Francis Chan, *Crazy Love*

**Why this fits Chapter 2:** Chan exposes our spiritual consumerism—we want God's benefits without wanting God. We want blessing, provision, answered prayer, spiritual experiences. But do we want HIM? Chapter 2 forces the question: Do we want God, or do we just want what God can give us?

## Summary for Chapter 2:

These quotes address:
- **Gratitude vs. possession** (Chesterton)
- **The heart as idol factory** (Calvin, Keller)
- **False self built on accumulation** (Merton, Tozer)
- **Detachment as freedom** (Weil)
- **Wanting gifts without the Giver** (Bonhoeffer, Chan)
- **God's abundance vs. our greed** (Dillard)
- **The God-shaped vacuum** (Pascal)

All support the chapter's central theme: even good things become toxic when we grasp them as identity, security, or salvation instead of receiving them as gifts from God.
