# Following the Frenzy: Identifying Our Idols

**Source:** Paige Brown sermon transcript on Elijah/Elisha (identifying idols through "following the frenzy")

## Core Concept

Paige Brown introduces a diagnostic tool for identifying modern idols in our lives by observing where we experience "frenzy" - the areas of anxiety, stress, desperation, and urgent prayer that reveal what we're really worshiping.

## Key Quote from Transcript

> "We have what I call Planned prayers... those prayers in some ways don't count. The prayers that really really count are the prayers in our dread and our desperation and in our stress. That's who we really are. That's what we really want. The stressed out can't keep them from pointing out please don't let this happen Lord please don't let this happen please give me this please don't take this away please please please for my kids for my spouse for my boyfriend for my roommate for my parents please please financially I can't lose my job I can't get caught in this sin I can't whatever it is..."

## The Diagnostic Framework

**Planned Prayers vs. Panic Prayers:**
- **Planned prayers:** Meals, bedtime with kids, Bible study openings - these reveal our religious performance
- **Panic prayers:** The desperate "PLEASE" prayers in stress, dread, and desperation - these reveal our true idols

**The Frenzy Reveals the Idol:**
The things that generate frenzy in our lives - where we can't sleep, where we obsess, where we frantically try to control outcomes - these expose what we're actually trusting for life, meaning, security, and identity.

## Application: Following Your Own Frenzy

Ask yourself:
- What generates the most anxiety in my life?
- What keeps me up at 3 AM?
- What are my desperate, unplanned prayers about?
- Where do I experience the most stress and urgency?
- What outcomes am I frantically trying to control?

Common areas of frenzy (modern idols):
- **Children's success/behavior** - "Please don't let my kid fail/get caught/embarrass me"
- **Career/job security** - "Please don't let me lose this job/opportunity"
- **Romantic relationships** - "Please don't let this person leave me"
- **Financial security** - "Please don't let us lose money/status"
- **Reputation/image** - "Please don't let people find out/think badly of me"
- **Health/appearance** - "Please don't let me age/get sick/lose attractiveness"

## Context: Brown's Larger Point About Purpose

Brown was teaching on Elisha's calling and making the point that:
1. **We internalize calling** as self-discovery rather than external obedience
2. **We over-spiritualize calling** as self-expression rather than God's work
3. **We miss calling** by being consumed with maintaining the lives we've already built

The "frenzy test" reveals what we're actually serving:

> "We've overblown this thing of calling, this elusive self-actualizing thing that we've got to go find... Only people with margin and resources ever talk that way. Somebody working on the assembly line just like their father before them and their father before him they don't talk about that. They're not preoccupied with finding themselves."

## Where This Fits in Your Grace Book

### **Best Placement: Chapter 3 - "STOP!!! And Make a Decision"**

**Why Chapter 3:**
- Chapter 3 is about the crossroads - choosing between the swamp and the water
- It already addresses choosing what to leave behind and what to step into
- The "frenzy" diagnostic would powerfully illustrate what we're actually choosing to serve

**How to Integrate:**

**Location:** In the section "Why Neutrality is a Myth" or in "The Two Paths" section

**Narrative approach:**

"Before we can choose the path toward grace, we need to identify what we've actually been serving. And there's a simple diagnostic that reveals our true idols: **Follow the frenzy.**

Where is the anxiety in your life? Not the mild concern - the frenzy. The thing that keeps you up at 3 AM. The situation that makes your heart race. The outcome you're desperately trying to control.

We have planned prayers - the ones before meals, at bedtime, at Bible study. Those prayers show what we think we should care about.

But then we have panic prayers. The ones we pray in dread, in desperation, in stress: 'Please don't let this happen, Lord. PLEASE. For my kids, for my marriage, for my job, for my reputation - PLEASE.'

Those prayers? They reveal what we actually worship.

- If your frenzy is around your children's success, your child has become your idol.
- If your frenzy is around your career advancement, your career is your idol.
- If your frenzy is around your relationship status, that person (or the idea of relationship) is your idol.
- If your frenzy is around your reputation, others' opinions are your idol.
- If your frenzy is around your financial security, money is your idol.

The frenzy reveals the idol. And the idol must die before you can follow Jesus.

When Elisha burned his oxen and plows, he wasn't just walking away from a career. He was killing the frenzy. He was choosing to let go of the thing that would have kept him up at night worrying, planning, controlling.

What's generating frenzy in your life right now? That's what you need to bring to the crossroads. Because you can't take your idol with you on the path toward grace. You have to choose: the frenzy or the freedom.

**Application Questions:**
- Complete this sentence honestly: 'Lord, PLEASE don't let __________.'
- What outcome are you frantically trying to control?
- Where does your mind race when you can't sleep?
- What would devastate you if you lost it?
- That's your idol. And it needs to die at this crossroads."

### **Alternative Placement: Chapter 4 - "Dying Changes Everything"**

Could also work in Chapter 4 in the "Death to Control" section, showing what specifically needs to die - not just abstract "control" but the specific idols revealed by our frenzy.

## Theological/Biblical Connections

**Jesus in Gethsemane:** Even Jesus's panic prayer ("Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me") reveals his true worship - not self-preservation but the Father's will ("Yet not my will but yours")

**Matthew 6:19-21:** "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" - The frenzy reveals where our treasure actually is

**Philippians 3:7-8:** Paul's "I count everything as loss" - He had to identify what was causing frenzy (his reputation, his status as a Pharisee) and declare it garbage

**1 Kings 18 - Elijah vs. Baal prophets:** Their frenzy (cutting themselves, shouting louder) revealed their false worship. True worship of Yahweh was calm, confident trust.

## Contemporary Relevance

This diagnostic is particularly powerful for:
- **Parents obsessed with children's outcomes** (the helicopter/lawnmower parent crisis)
- **Career-driven people** measuring worth by professional success
- **Image-conscious people** living for social media validation
- **Control-oriented people** who experience constant anxiety trying to manage outcomes
- **Relationally dependent people** who can't be alone/single

The beauty of "following the frenzy" is it's **self-evident** - people immediately recognize their own panic prayers and what they reveal.

## Summary for Integration

**Best use:** Chapter 3, in the section about choosing what to leave behind. The "frenzy test" provides a concrete diagnostic for identifying the idols that must die at the crossroads.

**Tone:** Confrontational but compassionate - Brown's approach is both challenging and understanding

**Power:** This isn't abstract theology about idols. It's: "Look at what you pray when you're desperate. That's your real god. And you're at a crossroads where you have to choose."
