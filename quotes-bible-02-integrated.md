# Chapter 2: Too Much of a Good Thing - Integrated Quotes & Scripture Guide

## Overview
This guide pairs author quotes with related Scripture passages, organized thematically to support Chapter 2's exploration of abundance vs. greed, possession vs. gift, and the insatiable hunger of the human heart. Each pairing creates dialogue between biblical truth and lived experience.

---

## THEME 1: The Insatiable Appetite - "More" Never Satisfies

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Insatiable Appetite of the Human Heart" (pages 3-4)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Blaise Pascal - The God-Shaped Vacuum

> "What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself."
>
> — Blaise Pascal, *Pensées*

**Why this fits:** Pascal identifies the root problem—we have an infinite hole that we try to fill with finite things. No matter how much we accumulate, it's never enough because we're trying to fill an infinite need with finite stuff.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Ecclesiastes 5:10-12 - The Futility of Accumulation

> "Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.
>
> As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?
>
> The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep."

**Why these pair together:** Pascal says we have an "infinite abyss" that can only be filled by God. The Preacher in Ecclesiastes says "whoever loves money never has enough... never satisfied." Both identify the same problem: the appetite is insatiable because we're seeking finite solutions to an infinite need. Pascal: the hole is infinite. Ecclesiastes: you'll never have enough because the hunger is bottomless. The paradox: abundance doesn't satisfy; it actually steals sleep. More possessions = more anxiety. Why? Because we're trying to fill a God-shaped void with God-substitutes.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Blaise Pascal, the brilliant mathematician and philosopher, identified the root issue..." [Insert Pascal quote]. Then: "The Preacher in Ecclesiastes observed the same reality 2,700 years earlier..." [Insert Ecclesiastes 5:10-12]. Then: "Pascal calls it an infinite abyss that only God can fill. Ecclesiastes says whoever loves wealth is never satisfied. Both diagnose the same disease: we're trying to fill an infinite need with finite things. That's why 'more' never works. The closet full of clothes doesn't satisfy. The streaming queue doesn't satisfy. The successful career doesn't satisfy. Because the hunger isn't for things—it's for God Himself."

---

## THEME 2: Hoarding What's Meant as Gift

### PLACEMENT: Section "Why 'More' Never Satisfies" (pages 4-5)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: A.W. Tozer - The Monstrous Substitution

> "There is within the human heart a tough fibrous root of fallen life whose nature is to possess, always to possess. It covets 'things' with a deep and fierce passion. The pronouns 'my' and 'mine' look innocent enough in print, but their constant and universal use is significant. They express the real nature of the old Adamic man better than a thousand volumes of theology could do. They are verbal symptoms of our deep disease. The roots of our hearts have grown down into things, and we dare not pull up one rootlet lest we die. Things have become necessary to us, a development never originally intended. God's gifts now take the place of God, and the whole course of nature is upset by the monstrous substitution."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Pursuit of God*

**Why this fits:** Tozer exposes the psychology of possession—how our hearts grow roots into things until we can't imagine life without them. "God's gifts now take the place of God."

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Exodus 16:13-21 - The Manna That Rotted

> "That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor...
>
> Moses said to them, 'It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat. This is what the LORD has commanded: "Everyone is to gather as much as they need..."'
>
> Then Moses said to them, 'No one is to keep any of it until morning.'
>
> However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them."

**Why these pair together:** Tozer says our hearts grow roots into things—we grasp, hoard, possess because "things have become necessary to us." The Israelites demonstrate this: God provides daily manna (gift), but they hoard it (possession). What happens? It breeds maggots and stinks. Tozer: "God's gifts now take the place of God—the monstrous substitution." Israel: when you try to possess what's meant to be received as daily gift, it rots. Both teach the same lesson: grasping destroys the gift. The cure isn't having less—it's holding loosely, receiving as gift rather than clutching as possession.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "A.W. Tozer diagnosed the disease of possession..." [Insert Tozer quote]. Then: "Israel learned this lesson in Exodus 16..." [Describe the manna story, Exodus 16:13-21]. Then: "Tozer says our hearts grow roots into things—we can't pull them up without feeling like we'll die. Israel couldn't trust God's daily provision—they had to hoard 'just in case.' Result? Maggots and stench. Tozer's 'monstrous substitution' is taking God's gifts and making them into gods. Israel's rotting manna shows what happens: when you try to possess what's meant as gift, it decays. The channel analogy fits here: when we hoard instead of receive, we clog the flow. Grace can't move through clenched fists."

## THEME 3: One Thing You Lack - The Idol We Can't Release

### PLACEMENT: Section "Learning the Difference Between Gift and Possession" (pages 5-6)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Timothy Keller - Defining Idolatry

> "What is an idol? It is anything more important to you than God, anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God, anything you seek to give you what only God can give. An idol is whatever you look at and say, in your heart of hearts, 'If I have that, then I'll feel my life has meaning, then I'll know I have value, then I'll feel significant and secure.'"
>
> — Timothy Keller, *Counterfeit Gods*

**Why this fits:** Keller defines functional idolatry—not just bad things, but good things we've made ultimate things.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Mark 10:17-27 - The Rich Young Ruler

> "As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. 'Good teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'...
>
> 'Teacher,' he declared, 'all these I have kept since I was a boy.'
>
> Jesus looked at him and loved him. 'One thing you lack,' he said. 'Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'
>
> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
>
> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!'... 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.'"

**Why these pair together:** Keller asks: What do you look at and say, "If I have that, then I'll feel my life has meaning"? For the rich young ruler, it was wealth. Jesus diagnosed it: "One thing you lack"—not more obedience (he'd kept the commandments), but freedom from the idol. Keller: an idol is anything more important than God. Jesus: "He went away sad, because he had great wealth." The wealth wasn't inherently evil—but his attachment to it was idolatrous. He couldn't let go. Both Keller and Jesus ask the reader: What's YOUR "great wealth"? What would you walk away sad rather than surrender? Success? Platform? Approval? Relationships? That's your idol.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Timothy Keller defines what an idol actually is..." [Insert Keller quote]. Then: "Jesus confronted this directly in His encounter with the rich young ruler..." [Tell the Mark 10:17-27 story]. Then: "Keller asks: What do you look at and think, 'If I have that, I'll be okay'? The rich young ruler looked at his wealth that way. Jesus loved him—and offered him freedom: 'One thing you lack. Let it go. Follow me.' But he couldn't. He walked away sad. The tragedy: he had everything except the One Thing, and he chose everything over the One Thing. Chapter 2 asks you: What's your 'great wealth'? What good thing has become an ultimate thing? What would Jesus ask you to hold loosely, and would you walk away sad?"

## THEME 4: Gift vs. Possession - Open Hands vs. Clenched Fists

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Difference Between God's Abundance and Our Greed" (pages 4-5)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: G.K. Chesterton - Gratitude Over Possession

> "The test of all happiness is gratitude; and I felt grateful, though I hardly knew to whom. Children are grateful when Santa Claus puts in their stockings gifts of toys or sweets. Could I not be grateful to Santa Claus when he put in my stockings the gift of two miraculous legs? We thank people for birthday presents of cigars and slippers. Can I thank no one for the birthday present of birth?"
>
> — G.K. Chesterton, *Orthodoxy*

**Why this fits:** Chesterton captures the shift from possession to gratitude. When you see everything as gift (even existence itself), you hold loosely.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Matthew 14:13-21 - Feeding the 5,000

> "As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, 'This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.'
>
> Jesus replied, 'They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.'
>
> 'We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,' they answered.
>
> 'Bring them here to me,' he said... Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over."

**Why these pair together:** Chesterton models gratitude—seeing even your legs, your very birth, as gift. The disciples model scarcity: "We have here ONLY five loaves and two fish." Same reality, different posture. Chesterton: grateful for what's given. Disciples: focused on what's lacking. What shifts it? Jesus "gave thanks" for what they had, then multiplied it. Chesterton and Jesus both teach: gratitude transforms scarcity into abundance. Not because the amount changes first, but because the posture changes. When you receive as gift (gratitude), there's always enough. When you grasp as possession (scarcity mindset), it's never enough. The disciples' "only" revealed their hearts. Jesus' thanksgiving revealed His. Chapter 2 asks: Are you living from scarcity or abundance? Possession or gift?

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "G.K. Chesterton captured the heart of receiving as gift..." [Insert Chesterton quote]. Then: "Jesus demonstrated this in the feeding of the 5,000..." [Tell Matthew 14:13-21 story]. Then: "Chesterton saw even his legs as miraculous gift. The disciples saw five loaves as 'only.' Same posture we take: scarcity ('I don't have enough') vs. gratitude ('Look what I've been given'). Jesus gave thanks for what they had, and it multiplied. Not magic—principle. When you receive as gift with gratitude, there's abundance. When you grasp as possession with fear, there's never enough. Open hands (gift) vs. clenched fists (possession). The amount doesn't change—the posture does."

## THEME 5: The Impostor Built on Accumulation

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Exhaustion of Trying to Manage It All" (pages 5-6)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Thomas Merton - The False Self

> "Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self. We are not very good at recognizing illusions, least of all the ones we cherish about ourselves. All sin starts from the assumption that my false self, the self that exists only in my own egocentric desires, is the fundamental reality of life to which everything else in the universe is ordered."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation*

**Why this fits:** Merton exposes how we build identity on the false self—defined by accomplishments, possessions, reputation. Chapter 2 explores the exhaustion of maintaining that.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Luke 12:13-21 - The Rich Fool

> "Someone in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.' Jesus replied, 'Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?' Then he said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.'
>
> And he told them this parable: 'The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, "What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops." Then he said, "This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll say to myself, 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.'"
>
> But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?" This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.'"

**Why these pair together:** Merton says the false self is built on "egocentric desires"—we make our possessions, accomplishments, accumulation the center of our identity. The rich fool in Jesus' parable embodies this: "I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones... I'll say to MYSELF... YOU have plenty... take life easy." Count the first-person pronouns: I, my, myself. His entire identity is wrapped up in what he owns. Merton: the false self assumes "everything else in the universe is ordered" around my egocentric desires. The rich fool: his whole world revolved around his barns, his grain, his security. Jesus: "You fool... this very night your life will be demanded." The false self built on accumulation collapses when you realize you can't take it with you. Merton and Jesus both say: life doesn't consist in possessions. Building identity on accumulation is building on sand.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Thomas Merton identified the false self we construct..." [Insert Merton quote]. Then: "Jesus told a parable about a man who built his entire identity on accumulation..." [Tell Luke 12:13-21]. Then: "Merton says the false self is built on egocentric desires. The rich fool's parable is one long first-person monologue: I, my, myself. His identity was his barns. Jesus called him a fool—not because he was rich, but because he was 'not rich toward God.' He'd built a false self on accumulation. And that night, it all collapsed. Chapter 2 confronts this: Have you built your identity on what you own, what you've accomplished, what you've accumulated? That's the false self. And it's exhausting to maintain—because you can never have enough to feel secure."

## THEME 6: Detachment as Freedom

### PLACEMENT: Section "Learning the Difference Between Gift and Possession" (pages 5-6)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Simone Weil - Reality Through Detachment

> "Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone who is detached."
>
> — Simone Weil, *Gravity and Grace*

**Why this fits:** Weil's concept of detachment isn't apathy—it's the freedom to see clearly. When you're not grasping, you can see reality as it is.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Philippians 4:11-13 - Learning Contentment

> "I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength."

**Why these pair together:** Weil says attachment creates illusion—we can't see reality clearly when we're clutching things. Paul says contentment is learned—it's not natural. And it's not based on circumstances (plenty or want) but on Christ's strength. Weil: detachment reveals reality. Paul: I've learned to be content whether I have abundance or scarcity. Both describe freedom from circumstantial attachment. Weil's "detachment" is Paul's "contentment"—not being controlled by what you have or don't have. Paul has detached his identity from his possessions: he can have plenty or be in need, and he's okay either way. Why? "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." The strength isn't in managing possessions; it's in depending on Christ. Weil and Paul both say: freedom comes from holding loosely.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Simone Weil, the French philosopher and mystic, wrote..." [Insert Weil quote]. Then: "The Apostle Paul modeled this detachment..." [Insert Philippians 4:11-13]. Then: "Weil says attachment fabricates illusions—we can't see clearly when we're clutching. Paul says he's learned contentment in both plenty and want—he's detached his identity from his circumstances. Weil calls it detachment. Paul calls it contentment. Both mean the same thing: freedom from being controlled by what you have or don't have. You can hold possessions with open hands because your strength isn't in managing them—it's in Christ. That's not apathy. That's freedom."

## THEME 7: God's Extravagance vs. Our Scarcity

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Difference Between God's Abundance and Our Greed" (pages 4-5)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Annie Dillard - God's Pizzazz

> "The creator loves pizzazz... Nature is, above all, profligate. Don't believe them when they tell you how economical and thrifty nature is, whose leaves return to the soil. Wouldn't it be cheaper to leave them on the tree in the first place? This deciduous business alone is a radical scheme, the brainchild of a deranged manic-depressive with limitless capital."
>
> — Annie Dillard, *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek*

**Why this fits:** Dillard captures God's wild generosity in creation. The Creator isn't stingy—He's extravagant, abundant, over-the-top generous.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Ecclesiastes 5:18-20 - Enjoying God's Gifts

> "This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart."

**Why these pair together:** Dillard describes God's extravagance in creation—"pizzazz," "profligate," "limitless capital." The Preacher in Ecclesiastes shifts from "whoever loves money is never satisfied" (v. 10) to "when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them... this is a gift of God" (v. 19). Both celebrate God's abundance. Dillard: nature reveals a Creator who loves extravagance. Ecclesiastes: when you receive abundance AS GIFT FROM GOD and enjoy it IN GOD, it brings gladness. The contrast in Ecclesiastes is crucial: loving wealth (v. 10) produces insatiable hunger; receiving wealth as gift from God (v. 19) produces gladness. Dillard and Ecclesiastes both say: God isn't stingy. The problem isn't abundance—it's grasping abundance as security instead of receiving it as gift.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Annie Dillard observed God's extravagance in nature..." [Insert Dillard quote]. Then: "The Preacher in Ecclesiastes makes a crucial distinction..." [Compare Ecclesiastes 5:10 with 5:18-20]. Then: "Dillard sees God's wild generosity everywhere—'pizzazz,' 'profligate,' 'limitless capital.' The Preacher says: when you love wealth, you're never satisfied (v. 10). But when God gives wealth and you receive it as gift and enjoy it IN Him, that's gladness (v. 19). See the shift? God isn't stingy—He's extravagant. Abundance isn't the problem. Grasping it as identity/security instead of receiving it as gift—that's the problem. God's abundance (gift, generosity, overflow) vs. our greed (grasping, hoarding, scarcity)."

## THEME 8: Wanting God or Just His Benefits?

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Wayfarer Moment" (pages 6-7)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Francis Chan - Do We Actually Want God?

> "The irony is that while God doesn't need us but still wants us, we desperately need God but don't really want Him most of the time. He treasures us and anticipates our departure from this earth to be with Him—and we wonder, indifferently, how much we have to do for Him to get by."
>
> — Francis Chan, *Crazy Love*

**Why this fits:** Chan exposes spiritual consumerism—we want God's benefits (blessing, provision, answered prayer) but do we want HIM?

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Proverbs 30:7-9 - The Prayer for "Just Enough"

> "Two things I ask of you, LORD; do not refuse me before I die: Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God."

**Why these pair together:** Chan asks: Do we want God, or just what God gives us? Agur's prayer in Proverbs 30 asks for "neither poverty nor riches, but... only my daily bread." Why? Because "too much" leads to forgetting God—"Who is the LORD?" This is spiritual consumerism: when we have abundance, we think we don't need God. We wanted His benefits (provision, blessing), not Him. Chan: "We desperately need God but don't really want Him most of the time." Agur: "I may have too much and disown you." Both identify the danger of "too much of a good thing"—abundance can make us self-sufficient, forgetting our need for God. The prayer isn't for poverty (that brings temptation too), but for "just enough" that keeps us dependent, remembering God.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Francis Chan confronts a hard question..." [Insert Chan quote]. Then: "Agur, in Proverbs 30, prayed a prayer that addresses this..." [Insert Proverbs 30:7-9]. Then: "Chan asks: Do we want God, or just His benefits? Agur prays for 'just enough'—not too much (lest I forget God and say 'Who is the LORD?'), not too little (lest I dishonor Him). The danger of abundance isn't the abundance itself—it's that it makes us self-sufficient. We stop wanting God because we think we don't need Him. Chapter 2's wayfarer moment: Admitting that even good things become idols when we use them to avoid God. Do you want more blessings... or do you want God Himself?"

---

## THEME 9: Cheap Grace and Wanting Gifts Without the Giver

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Wayfarer Moment" (pages 6-7)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: Dietrich Bonhoeffer - Cheap Grace

> "Cheap grace is the grace we bestow on ourselves. Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession... Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."
>
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*

**Why this fits:** Bonhoeffer's "cheap grace" applies to Chapter 2: wanting God's gifts without God, blessing without surrender, spiritual experiences without transformation.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 6:6-10 - Godliness with Contentment

> "But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."

**Why these pair together:** Bonhoeffer warns against "cheap grace"—wanting forgiveness without repentance, blessing without surrender. Paul warns "those who want to get rich fall into temptation... wander from the faith... pierce themselves with many griefs." Both identify the same disease: wanting the benefits without the relationship. Bonhoeffer: grace without discipleship. Paul: pursuing wealth instead of godliness with contentment. The "love of money" (not money itself) is the root of evil because it's seeking security, satisfaction, identity in wealth instead of in God. Both say: you can't have God's gifts without God. That's cheap grace. That's wandering from faith. The alternative? "Godliness with contentment is great gain"—seeking God Himself, and finding in Him what money/success/platform can never give.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned against what he called 'cheap grace'..." [Insert Bonhoeffer quote]. Then: "Paul warned Timothy about the same dynamic regarding wealth..." [Insert 1 Timothy 6:6-10]. Then: "Bonhoeffer: cheap grace is wanting God's benefits without God—forgiveness without repentance, blessing without surrender. Paul: those who want to get rich wander from the faith and pierce themselves with griefs. Both expose the same lie: you can have the gifts without the Giver. You can pursue success, wealth, platform, and think 'I'm blessed' without actually pursuing God. That's cheap grace. That's wandering from faith. Chapter 2's confrontation: Are you seeking God, or just what God can give you? Godliness with contentment—seeking Him—is the great gain."

---

## THEME 10: The Heart as Idol Factory

### PLACEMENT: Section "The Wayfarer Moment" (pages 6-7)

### AUTHOR QUOTE: John Calvin - Expert Idol Makers

> "The human heart is a factory of idols... Everyone of us is, from his mother's womb, expert in inventing idols."
>
> — John Calvin, *Institutes of the Christian Religion*

**Why this fits:** Calvin names the core truth of Chapter 2—we don't just make idols of bad things; we make idols of EVERYTHING, especially good things.

### PAIRED SCRIPTURE: Haggai 1:5-6 - The Purse with Holes

> "Now this is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Give careful thought to your ways. You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.'"

**Why these pair together:** Calvin says the human heart is an "idol factory"—we're expert at making gods out of gifts. Haggai describes what that looks like in practice: working hard, accumulating constantly, but never satisfied. "You have planted much, but harvested little... never have enough... never have your fill... purse with holes in it." Why? Because when you make an idol out of work, success, or wealth, it can never deliver. Calvin: we're expert idol-makers. Haggai: and the result is exhaustion with no satisfaction—the purse has holes. Both say: when you seek in created things what only the Creator can give, you'll work endlessly and still be empty. The solution isn't working harder or accumulating more—it's giving careful thought to your ways and realizing: I've been seeking satisfaction in idols. And idols always disappoint.

### INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Write: "John Calvin observed that the human heart is..." [Insert Calvin quote]. Then: "The prophet Haggai described what this looks like..." [Insert Haggai 1:5-6]. Then: "Calvin says we're expert idol-makers from birth. Haggai shows the result: planting much but harvesting little, eating but never full, earning but the purse has holes. Why? Because when you make an idol of work, success, wealth—when you seek satisfaction there instead of in God—it can never deliver. That's the 'too much of a good thing' paradox: you can accumulate endlessly and still be empty. Because the heart is seeking in created things what only the Creator can give. Give careful thought to your ways: What idols have you made? And are you willing to smash them?"
