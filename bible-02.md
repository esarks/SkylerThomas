# Bible Passages for Chapter 2: Too Much of a Good Thing

## Theme: Abundance, Greed, Idolatry, Possessions, Trust vs. Hoarding

---

## PRIMARY PASSAGES (Core to the chapter's argument)

### 1. Ecclesiastes 5:10-20 - The Futility of Wealth

> **Ecclesiastes 5:10-12**
> "Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless. As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them? The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep."
>
> **Ecclesiastes 5:18-20**
> "This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart."

**Why this passage is essential:** This is THE theological anchor for Chapter 2. Ecclesiastes names the paradox: abundance doesn't satisfy when we grasp it as security or identity (v. 10-12), but when we receive it as gift from God and enjoy it IN God, it brings gladness (v. 18-20). The difference isn't the amount—it's the posture.

### 2. Exodus 16:13-21 - The Manna Story (Hoarding What's Meant as Gift)

> "That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, 'What is it?' For they did not know what it was.
>
> Moses said to them, 'It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat. This is what the LORD has commanded: "Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent."'
>
> The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
>
> Then Moses said to them, 'No one is to keep any of it until morning.'
>
> However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
>
> Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away."

**Why this passage is essential:** This is the perfect illustration of the chapter's core truth: when you try to possess what's meant to be received as daily gift, it rots. The Israelites who hoarded discovered that grasping produces decay. Trust produces provision. This story should be told in detail, with sensory language—the smell of rotting manna, the sight of worms, the lesson learned.

### 3. Mark 10:17-27 - The Rich Young Ruler (One Thing You Lack)

> "As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. 'Good teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'
>
> 'You know the commandments: "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother."'
>
> 'Teacher,' he declared, 'all these I have kept since I was a boy.'
>
> Jesus looked at him and loved him. 'One thing you lack,' he said. 'Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'
>
> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
>
> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!'
>
> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, 'Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.'
>
> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, 'Who then can be saved?'
>
> Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.'"

**Why this passage is essential:** This story breaks hearts because it's so relatable. The man had everything except the One Thing, and he chose everything over the One Thing. The tragedy: Jesus LOVED him (v. 21) and offered him freedom, but he couldn't let go. Key detail: his wealth wasn't the problem—his attachment to it was. Chapter 2 asks readers: What's YOUR "great wealth"? What would you walk away sad rather than surrender?

### 4. Matthew 14:13-21 - Feeding the 5,000 (Scarcity vs. Abundance)

> "When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
>
> As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, 'This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.'
>
> Jesus replied, 'They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.'
>
> 'We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,' they answered.
>
> 'Bring them here to me,' he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children."

**Why this passage is essential:** The disciples' scarcity mindset ("We have here ONLY...") contrasts with Jesus' abundance. When you give what you have to Jesus, trusting Him to multiply it, there's more than enough. But you have to let go—place it in His hands, release control. The chapter contrasts scarcity (hoarding, fear, grasping) with abundance (trust, generosity, open hands).

## SUPPORTING PASSAGES (Reinforce themes)

### 5. Luke 12:13-21 - The Parable of the Rich Fool

> "Someone in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.'
>
> Jesus replied, 'Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?' Then he said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.'
>
> And he told them this parable: 'The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, "What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops."
>
> Then he said, "This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll say to myself, 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.'"
>
> But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?"
>
> This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.'"

**Application:** Jesus explicitly warns against greed and the illusion that security comes from accumulation. The rich fool's problem wasn't wealth—it was trust. He trusted his barns, not God. Chapter 2 explores what we're trusting in: our success, our platform, our relationships, our gifts?

### 6. 1 Timothy 6:6-10 - Godliness with Contentment

> "But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."

**Application:** Paul names the trap: the desire for wealth (not wealth itself) leads to temptation, harmful desires, ruin. The love of money is THE root of all kinds of evil. Why? Because it promises what only God can give—security, worth, satisfaction. When we seek those things in money (or success, or approval), we wander from faith and "pierce ourselves with many griefs."

### 7. Matthew 6:19-21, 24 - Treasures and Two Masters

> "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also...
>
> No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."

**Application:** Jesus doesn't say wealth is evil. He says you can't serve two masters. The chapter's key question: What are you serving? Your treasure reveals your heart. If your platform, success, or reputation is your treasure, that's where your heart is—and you're serving the wrong master.

### 8. Philippians 4:11-13 - Learning Contentment

> "I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength."

**Application:** Paul has learned contentment—it's not natural, it's learned. Whether he has abundance or scarcity, his contentment is in Christ, not circumstances. Chapter 2 explores this: Can you be content in Christ regardless of whether you have "too much" or "too little"? The secret isn't in managing possessions; it's in depending on Christ for strength.

### 9. Proverbs 30:7-9 - The Prayer for "Just Enough"

> "Two things I ask of you, LORD; do not refuse me before I die: Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God."

**Application:** Agur's prayer is brilliant—he asks for neither poverty nor riches, but "just enough." Why? Because too much leads to forgetting God ("Who is the LORD?"), and too little leads to dishonoring God through desperation. This is the danger of "too much of a good thing"—abundance can make us self-sufficient, forgetting our need for God.

---

### 10. Haggai 1:5-6 - Working Hard, Gaining Nothing

> "Now this is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Give careful thought to your ways. You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.'"

**Application:** This describes the futility of the "more" treadmill. Working hard, consuming constantly, but never satisfied. The purse with holes—accumulating but never having enough. Chapter 2 explores why: because we're seeking satisfaction in the wrong place.

## SUMMARY OF BIBLICAL THEMES FOR CHAPTER 2:

1. **Ecclesiastes 5** - Loving money/wealth never satisfies; receiving as gift from God brings gladness
2. **Exodus 16** - Hoarding what's meant as daily gift produces rot
3. **Mark 10** - Attachment to possessions keeps us from following Jesus
4. **Matthew 14** - Scarcity mindset vs. trusting God's abundance
5. **Luke 12** - Life doesn't consist in abundance of possessions; storing up for self vs. being rich toward God
6. **1 Timothy 6** - Godliness with contentment; love of money is root of evil
7. **Matthew 6** - Can't serve two masters; treasure reveals heart
8. **Philippians 4** - Learned contentment in Christ regardless of circumstances
9. **Proverbs 30** - Too much makes us forget God; asking for "just enough"
10. **Haggai 1** - The futility of working hard but never having enough

These passages build the case: possessions aren't evil, but grasping them as identity/security/satisfaction is. The answer isn't poverty; it's open hands, trust, and contentment in God.
